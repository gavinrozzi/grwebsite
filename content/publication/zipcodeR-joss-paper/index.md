abstract: 'zipcodeR is a new R package intended to make working with datasets containing U.S. ZIP codes easier & simplify the process of relating ZIP code level data to other geographies in R. The package provides an offline database of ZIP codes & related socio-demographic data for over 41,000 ZIP codes in all 50 states.  It enables the efficient retrieval of ZIP codes at the national, state & county level along with geocoding existing data containg ZIP codes for use in research.zipcodeR addresses limitations inherent in past packages to provide a new, general-purpose solution to assist with processing ZIP code-level data.'
