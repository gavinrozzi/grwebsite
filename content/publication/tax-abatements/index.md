abstract = "New Jersey municipalities can grant tax abatements, which allow for a significant reduction or elimination of property taxes paid to local government by certain types of development projects. Currently, New Jersey law gives municipalities broad discretion to grant tax abatements; the vast majority of abatements negotiated between municipalities and developers do not provide for any revenue to taxing entities other than the municipal government â€“ such ascounties, fire districts and boards of education. This is because existing state law does not require themunicipality to distribute the revenue derived from abatements as they do regular property taxes collected from other properties with their borders."
