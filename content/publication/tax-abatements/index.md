abstract: New Jersey municipalities can grant tax abatements, which allow for a significant
  reduction or elimination of property taxes paid to local government by certain types
  of development projects. Currently, New Jersey law gives municipalities broad discretion
  to grant tax abatements; the vast majority of abatements negotiated between municipalities
  and developers do not provide for any revenue to taxing entities other than the
  municipal government â€“ such ascounties, fire districts and boards of education.
  This is because existing state law does not require themunicipality to distribute
  the revenue derived from abatements as they do regular property taxes collected
  from other properties with their borders.
