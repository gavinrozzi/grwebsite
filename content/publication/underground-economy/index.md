abstract: 'The William J. Hughes Center for Public Policy was contracted to study
  the underground commercial construction economy in the state of New Jersey in 2016
  for the Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers Labor Management Committee of New Jersey,
  the Carpenter Contractor Trust, Associated Construction Contractors of New Jersey
  and Masonry Contractors of New Jersey. This research took a multi-pronged approach
  in exploring policy and best practices, presenting a data-driven analysis of the
  underground economy in New Jersey, and allowing construction leaders to speak freely
  about their experiences in the industry. The BACNJ and industry partners ACCNJ,
  MCNJ, Northeast Regional Council of Carpenters and Operating Engineers Local #825
  contracted with the Hughes Center to update its original research in spring 2019.
  This report contains the updated findings. This report finds that the underground
  construction economy continues to thrive in New Jersey despite attention resulting
  from the original report and some steps taken by the state government to address
  the problem.'
