abstract: 'State freedom of information laws are vital mechanisms for providing public
  access to government records and supporting civic engagement through the effectuation
  of a public policy of transparency at the state level within the United States,
  not unlike their federal counterpart, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). A broad
  array of government documents and data can be obtained by individuals using these
  statutes, subject to certain exemptions. New Jersey state law facilitates public
  access to government records under the Open Public Records Act (OPRA). Codified
  at N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1 et seq., OPRA applies to state, county and local public authorities
  but exempts the judicial and legislative branches from its disclosure requirements.
  Since OPRA took effect in 2002, it has been difficult to track the full extent of
  law’s impact across New Jersey’s 21 counties, 565 municipalities, and numerous state
  agencies, school districts and independent authorities, all of which must individually
  respond to requests under the law. To the best of the author’s knowledge, no official
  source has compiled detailed metadata tracking the content and disposition of OPRA
  requests at the state, regional and municipal levels within New Jersey using individual
  requests, and authorities rarely proactively disclose their responses to requests
  they receive, necessitating further data collection to support research into the
  impacts of this law. This article presents the OPRAmachine dataset: data containing
  detailed metadata on public records requests submitted to state & local public authorities
  in New Jersey since October 2017 collected through the implementation of information
  and communication technologies (ICT) to facilitate the freedom of information request
  process. The data was collected using an open-source web interface that allowed
  users to submit an OPRA request to public authorities, with responses stored in
  a database and made available via the internet. After their request received a response,
  users were asked to answer a single survey question describing the status of their
  request, with their answer used to classify the request. Descriptive statistics,
  tables and frequencies were produced for the dataset and are included in this article.
  These data will assist state policymakers and other interested parties with assessing
  trends in OPRA requests across multiple types of public authorities & geographic
  regions. These data can inform more efficient government records management procedures,
  foster civic engagement by increasing government transparency and can inform the
  development of possible reforms to the OPRA law by showing trends in requests &
  responses that can be used to evaluate the law’s implementation throughout the state.'
