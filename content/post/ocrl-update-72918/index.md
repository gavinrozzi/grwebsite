title: Big upgrades to OC Radio Live
---
Today I am proud to announce that we have added a significant number of new channels to [Ocean County Radio Live](https://ocradio.live), my online police fire & EMS scanner and archive service.
The service now supports listening to two 700 MHz digital trunked radio systems, Ocean County's and the New Jersey Interoperability Communications System, which hosts channels for the State Police,
Fish & Wildlife and numerous other state and local agencies.

Adding these new systems to our service is important because many people are missing out on listening to these systems because of the [high price](https://amzn.to/2LJX7TX) of purchasing a new scanner,
along with the technical complexity of programming the scanner. My service eliminates both of these problems, while adding several exciting new features that make scanning even better.

In partnership with [Ocean County Scanner News](https://ocscanner.news/2018/07/29/ocsn-scanner-less-dispatchers-wanted/) we have made significant infrastructure and server upgrades to support the addition of more channels through the purchase of additional software defined radios.
We hope to have additional channels added soon, along with restoring our coverage of the barrier island, Toms River and Brick, which had to be temporarily taken offline to make room for the 700 MHz upgrades.

Finally, it goes without saying that there is a cost to provide this service. We would like to thank all those who have purchased a premium subscription, as it directly support additional upgrades.
Please consider purhasing a [premium archive access plan](https://ocradio.live/plans/) to listen our archives and support the development of OC Radio Live, or consider [supporting me on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/gavinrozzi) to enable future public service web development & transparency projects.
