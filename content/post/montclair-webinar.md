On Tuesday, August 21st, 2018 I made my way up to the Montclair University Center for Cooperative Media to present about my work creating the [OPRAmachine](/projects/opramachine/) New Jersey statewide freedom of information portal.

The webinar was attended by both journalists and other individuals interested in making use of the advanced public records research capabilities provided by our platform.

Thank you to the folks at the Center who helped put all of this together, and thank you to our attendees who asked insightful questions!
