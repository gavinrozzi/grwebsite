On on April 5th, 2018 I joined WLFR Radio's **Watt's The Move**, Stocton University'show
own radio show that focuses on poliitics and public affairs.

During my one hour segment I discussed my work on several fronts. Our interview began with
talk of my work with my first and most successful project, [Ocean County Politics](https://www.gavinrozzi.com/project/politicsoc/)
and later pivoted to my work with the [OPRAmachine](https://www.gavinrozzi.com/project/opramachine/) freedom of information portal and
how it is making New Jersey government more transparent as a result of its impact.

The final segment of the show was spent discussing my analysis of the upcoming 2018 primary races, specifically with regard to the senate
and congressional seats that will be in play.

WLFR is the student-run radio station of Stockton University, and broadcasts
in Galloway Township, NJ on 91.7 MHz and also has [a feed online](http://wlfr.fm/)
