### I would like to thank everyone who has supported me in my campaign to seek the vacant seat on the Lacey Board of Education.

While I was not chosen by the board tonight, I will continue to advocate for our district and our residents. More to come on that in the near future.

I congratulate Skip Peters on his appointment and wish him all the best as he begins his tenure.

The video below shows my comments from tonightâ€™s meeting.
