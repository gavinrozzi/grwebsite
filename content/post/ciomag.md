CIO Magazine [wanted my take](https://www.cio.com/article/2460827/search/seo-sem-top-25-diy-tips-for-better-seo.html) on tips you can take to improve search engine rankings for small business websites for an article entitled "Top 25 DIY Tips for Better SEO."

Here’s what I had to say:

>WordPress is, in essence, a blogging platform. But many businesses use it as the content management system for a complete website.

>Yoast’s WordPress SEO Plugin (free) is a favorite among many SEO experts. “I recommend it to my clients because it allows the automation and easy integration of important SEO strategies,” says Gavin Rozzi, president, Gavin Rozzi Technology.

>Drupal and Joomla are two worthy WordPress alternatives, Rozzi says. “These free, open-source content management systems come with an assortment of plug-ins that automate much of the SEO workload.”
