# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "The [Rutgers Urban and Civic Informatics Lab (RUCI Lab)](https://rucilab.rutgers.edu/) was recently founded at the Bloustein School, with the mission of using new sources of data and emerging technologies to study the health of cities, and by doing so, improve the quality of urban life. This week, Stuart Shapiro talks with the Bloustein School's newest employee, Gavin Rozzi, who joined the school as a Research Computing Specialist for the RUCI Lab just days before the state's stay-at-home order took effect. They discuss some of the projects the RUCI Lab will be working on, including using geographic and social media data to predict the long-term social and economic impacts of COVID-19 on society, as well as Gavin's personal interest utilizing emerging technology -- 3D printing PPEs for frontline healthcare workers."
