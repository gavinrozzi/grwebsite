abstract: The [Rutgers Urban and Civic Informatics Lab (RUCI Lab)](https://rucilab.rutgers.edu/)
  was recently founded at the Bloustein School, with the mission of using new sources
  of data and emerging technologies to study the health of cities, and by doing so,
  improve the quality of urban life. This week, Stuart Shapiro talks with the Bloustein
  School's newest employee, Gavin Rozzi, who joined the school as a Research Computing
  Specialist for the RUCI Lab just days before the state's stay-at-home order took
  effect. They discuss some of the projects the RUCI Lab will be working on, including
  using geographic and social media data to predict the long-term social and economic
  impacts of COVID-19 on society, as well as Gavin's personal interest utilizing emerging
  technology -- 3D printing PPEs for frontline healthcare workers.
