Join me in late August at the Montclair University [Center for Cooperative Media](https://centerforcooperativemedia.org/) to talk about my recent work with [OPRAmachine](/project/opramachine) and give a step-by-step demonstration along with taking audience questions.

**Here is their official announcement of the event, copied below:**

"Opening up New Jersey government, one request at a time." That's the tagline of OPRAmachine.com, a free tool created by New Jersey's own Gavin Rozzi and available for all to use.

Every citizen has the right to access public records held by state & local government agencies under the New Jersey Open Public Records Act (OPRA). By law, they have to respond. The problem is, the process for requesting those documents isn't always as easy and straightforward as it should be â€“ until now.

Join this webinar and Rozzi will show you the simple, step-by-step process for filing OPRA requests and browsing OPRAmachine to see what public records and information others have requested
