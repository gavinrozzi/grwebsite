[1033 Watch](https://rozzi.shinyapps.io/1033watch/) is an open-source, interactive dashboard tracking shipments of military hardware to state & local law enforcement agencies under the 1033 program.
The program allows the Department of Defense to dispose of unneeded military equipment by giving it to local law enforcement agencies, who receive the equipment for free but must cover the cost of shipping.

I was motivated to create the dashboard amid the demonstrations and protests taking place within the US regarding police brutality, as many have criticized the 1033 program for encouraging the militarization of local police departments and escalation of force against peaceful demonstrators.

The dashboard utilizes R, Shiny and Flexdashboard. Pull requests will be accepted for additional views and visualizations.
