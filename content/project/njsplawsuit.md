The case Libertarians for Transparent Government v. New Jersey State Police was an important case that revealed
unacceptable practices by the New Jersey State Police.

I participated in the case by way of filing a certification detailing my experience with attempting to obtain helicopter usage logs
for then-New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's usage of State Police helicopters.
