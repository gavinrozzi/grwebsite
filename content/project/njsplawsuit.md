## New Jersey State Police held accountable in court for stalling on public records requests

The case Libertarians for Transparent Government v. New Jersey State Police was an important case that revealed
unacceptable practices by the New Jersey State Police.

I participated in the case by way of filing a certification detailing my experience with attempting to obtain helicopter usage logs
for then-New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's usage of State Police helicopters.
