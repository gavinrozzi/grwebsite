## New Jersey State Police held accountable in court for stalling on public records requests

The case Libertarians for Transparent Government v. New Jersey State Police was an important case that revealed
unacceptable practices by the New Jersey State Police.

The case revealed a pattern and practice of failure to comply with the requirements of the state's Open Public Records Act (OPRA) after a judge in the case issued a ruling. 

I participated in the case by way of filing a certification detailing my experience with attempting to obtain helicopter usage logs
for then-New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's usage of State Police helicopters. My certification details my own experience with the State Police and how they took repeated extensions prior to providing me with heavily redacted helicopter usage records.
