[Ocean County Radio Live](https://ocradio.live/) is taking the technical complexity and hassle out of scanning in Ocean County, New Jersey. I recently launched this website at the beginning of 2018.

This website uses software defined radio (SDR) technology to process the streams of digital data produced by the Ocean County trunked radio system. The SDRs record radio transmissions and upload them to the site's server, which allows them to easily be played and archived online.

The system has a major advantage over all traditional forms of radio scanning as it uses "time shifting" like a DVR does when recording multiple overlapping TV shows, ensuring that no transmissions are missed, since traditional scanners can only hold on one channel - potentially missing other calls.

As our base of users continues to grow, I intend on covering more radio systems and adding them to this system.

Ocean County Radio Live is based on the open-source "trunk-player" application.
