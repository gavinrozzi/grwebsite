Ocean County Scanner News is a network of radio and emergency services enthusiasts who listen to
police scanners and post live news updates via their Facebook page. I designed the groups's website
in addition to setting up a livestream server running the Icecast software package. The live feed covers
the Ocean County Trunked Radio system and several other local conventional channels. We are planning more
additions to the live feed as time and resources allow.
