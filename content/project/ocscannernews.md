## Live police, fire & EMS calls as they happen

[Ocean County Scanner News ](https://ocscanner.news/) is a network of radio and emergency services enthusiasts who listen to police scanners and post live news updates via their [Facebook page.](https://www.facebook.com/OceanCountyScannerNews/) I designed the groups's website in addition to setting up a live scanner feed server running the Icecast live streaming server. The main live feed covers the Ocean County Trunked Radio system and several other local conventional channels for police, fire & EMS agencies serving Ocean County. We are planning more additions to the live feed as time and resources allow.

Many of the breaking news updates posted on Ocean County Scanner News are reflective of breaking news stories that later are reported in the media - oftentimes days later as many outlets wait for official press releases.
