## Serving the Forked River, NJ amateur radio community

The Forked River Amateur Radio Club is a new amateur radio club formed to serve amateur radio community of Forked River, NJ and surrounding areas. I currently serve as both the vice president and webmaster of the club. We anticipate on pursuing several projects through this club, such as 2 meter FM repeater and 70 cm band DMR system to cover the Lacey area.

Given the impact that weather events like Hurricane Sandy have had on the region, we felt that an amateur radio group focused exclusively on our area would be beneficial to both the local amateur radio community as well as the public at large.
