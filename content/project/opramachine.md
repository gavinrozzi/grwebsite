OPRAmachine.com is a first of its kind government transparency project to launch in New Jersey. The site allows any citizen to easily file a legally valid public records request under New Jersey's state freedom of information law, the Open Public Records Act (OPRA). The site has enabled requesters to obtain thousands of pages worth of public records, helping to shine a light on some of the more obscure elements of New Jersey state and local government.

The site has been making an impact and has been used as a research tool by public officials, journalists and activists seeking to obtain authoritative information about public entities in the state.
