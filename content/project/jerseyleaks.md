JerseyLeaks is a whistleblowing and collaborative journalism tool that allows
sources to confidentially leak documents to reporters using an encrypted online system.
The system allows whistleblowers with knowledge of public corruption to submit documents to journalists who may publish them as a part of an investigative story.

This project has been a collaborative effort and other journalists are invited to join the platform.
