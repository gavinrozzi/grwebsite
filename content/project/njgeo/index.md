[njgeo](https://gavinrozzi.github.io/njgeo/) is an R package that provides an interface to the geocoding REST APIs maintained by the New Jersey Office of GIS (NJGOIS).

Unlike commercial services, these APIs are freely available to use and support geocoding addresses and intersections in New Jersey.

This package provides an R interface to this API to enable freely geocoding spatial data directly within R withouth having to install a desktop version of ArcGIS.
