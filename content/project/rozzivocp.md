The **New Jersey Government Records Council** (GRC) ruled in my favor and declared that the
response provided to an Open Public Records Act (OPRA) request was legally insufficient under the OPRA law's requirements. The GRC complaint was filed in 2015 and was adjudicated by the GRC after a nearly two-year wait time.

This case was filed at the same time a lawsuit that was filed against the OCPO by open government activist Harry Scheeler. Scheeler's lawsuit sought similar documents as those that were issue in this case.
