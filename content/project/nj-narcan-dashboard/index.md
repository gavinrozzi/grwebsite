[The NJ Narcan Dashboard](https://rozzi.shinyapps.io/nj-narcan-dashboard/) is an open-source, interactive dashboard tracking the extent to which opiate overdoses are occuring in New Jersey by analyzing trends in law enforcement Narcan (Naloxone) deployments, a powerful drug that can reverse fatal opiate overdoses.

This dashboard makes use of [deck.gl](https://deck.gl/) for 3D, interactive maps. The dashboard is currently a work in progress and will be integrated with other research projects in the near future, including linking with social and demographic data obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau.

The dashboard currently contains complete data on law enforcement Narcan incidents in New Jersey for 2019 and will be updated with 2020 data in future iterations.
