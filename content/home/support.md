### Make a contribution or purchase a subscription
The easiest way to help support my work is to [support me with a monthly contribution on Patreon](https://patreon.com/gavinrozzi/).
The biggest expense to support my operation each month is typically server space and related web hosting expenses.

If you would like to support my work with **software defined radio (SDR)** such as [OC Radio Live](https://ocradio.live/), please consider subscribing
to a [premium plan](https://ocradio.live/plans/) at a reasonable monthly rate. The premium plan will enable additional features
of the site as well as enable you to go as far back as two months back in time in our archives. Premium plan subscriptions help us to add more channels and defray the costs of web hosting.
