**Ocean County College (Fall, 2017):**

- ALDC 102 - [Addictions Counseling II ](https://legacy.ocean.edu/content/public/study-on-campus/academics/college-catalog.html/courses/5305)

In this class, working with Professor John A. Brogan, Sr., I participated in an exercise that saw the students create their own jobs program for recovering addicts. Students addressed recidivism and integrating recovering addicts into community organizations & programs.

A significant role that I played in this class was providing technology assistance to the professor and helping to modernize teaching methods.

**Stockton University (Fall, 2018):**

For the fall, 2018 semester I served as the teaching assistant for two of Professor Linda J. Wharton's classes at Stockton. Both courses feature in-depth study & discussion of key decisions of the United States Supreme Court.
