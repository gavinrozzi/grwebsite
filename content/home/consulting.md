I am available for hire as a consultant for commercial projects and partners interested in utilizing my services.

Some of the types of projects I am interested include:

* Web development projects (WordPress etc.)
* IT and technology projects (Linux and Windows server issues)
* Writing and copyediting projects
* Video production and photography

I have created this section of my website due to the numerous inquiries I receive from users of my web services.

**Public records research services**

Due to my reputation for making use of the New Jersey Open Public Records Act (OPRA) for investigative reporting, I am
often asked about assisting in researching a given topic for individuals and business owners using OPRA. I will soon be offering OPRA research services for those
who would like to have me research a specific topic and provide them with the records I obtain.

Rates for these services will be announced on this website at a later date.

I **cannot** provide legal advice to you about an OPRA request or how to proceed with a specific legal strategy.

Please [contact me](https://www.gavinrozzi.com/#contact) if you would like to discuss a potential project.
