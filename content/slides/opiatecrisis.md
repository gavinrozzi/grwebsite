# Narcan

Narcan is a powerful tool for reversing opiate overdoses. 

Each time it is administered, a form is sent to the county prosecutor's and state attorney general's office.

## 911 Call Data

Some towns including Toms River and Seaside Heights are adopting a system called Active911 to coordinate first responders.

---

## 911 Call Data From Active911

The app tracks and maps first responders using smartphones. It is proving to be a rich source of data requestable under OPRA.
