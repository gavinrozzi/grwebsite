---

## Key Additions

### 1. Research Leadership & Academic Affiliations

**New Research Paragraph Added:**
A comprehensive paragraph was inserted that establishes the foundational academic work:

> "My work at the intersection of data science, public policy, and urban studies began in academia, where I served as the founding Data Scientist at the Rutgers Urban and Civic Informatics Lab—a flagship research center of the executive dean. In this pioneering role, I established the lab's technical infrastructure and analytical capabilities, bridging computational methods with urban policy research. I also served as a Research Affiliate at the New Jersey State Policy Lab, where I led a critical research project examining the opioid crisis through advanced spatial data analysis, applying geographic information systems and statistical modeling to inform state-level policy interventions. Through my affiliation with the Master of Public Informatics program at Rutgers University, I've contributed to training the next generation of civic technologists who bring data-driven approaches to public sector challenges."

**Strategic Placement:**
- Positioned between the core pillars paragraph and the civic technology paragraph
- Creates a logical narrative arc: government work → academic research → civic tech innovation → education/credentials
- Establishes credibility before discussing entrepreneurial ventures

### 2. Enhanced Narrative Integration

**Updated OPRAmachine/zipcodeR Paragraph:**
Added a connecting sentence to the existing paragraph:

> "This combination of research leadership, civic technology innovation, and practical government experience positions me uniquely to tackle complex policy challenges through rigorous analytical methods and modern technical solutions."

**Benefits:**
- Ties together three distinct career phases
- Emphasizes the unique value proposition
- Demonstrates how different experiences compound

### 3. Expanded Core Expertise

**Updated Data Science Pillar:**
Enhanced the description to explicitly mention spatial analysis:

**Before:**
> "Using data to drive decision-making and measure impact"

**After:**
> "Advanced analytics, spatial data analysis, and GIS to drive evidence-based decision-making"

**Impact:**
- Highlights specialized technical skills (GIS, spatial analysis)
- Directly connects to the research work described
- More specific and credible

### 4. Updated Leadership & Recognition Section

**Added Research Positions:**
Placed academic roles at the top of the recognition list:

1. ✅ Founding Data Scientist, Rutgers Urban & Civic Informatics Lab
2. ✅ Research Affiliate, NJ State Policy Lab
3. Certified Public Manager Candidate
4. Governor's Team of Excellence (2025)
5. First Place, NJ DEP GIS Contest (2022)
6. Excellence in Local News Award (2019)

**Strategic Ordering:**
- Leadership roles first (establishes founding/pioneering narrative)
- Current credentials next (CPM, Governor's Award)
- Past recognitions follow
- Creates a comprehensive picture of career achievements

## Writing Approach & Tone

### First-Person Perspective ✅
All content written in first person to maintain consistency with existing profile:
- "I served as..."
- "I established..."
- "I led..."
- "I've contributed..."

### Professional Academic Tone ✅
Language choices emphasize:
- **Institutional prestige**: "flagship research center of the executive dean"
- **Leadership**: "founding Data Scientist," "pioneering role," "established"
- **Expertise**: "advanced spatial data analysis," "geographic information systems," "statistical modeling"
- **Impact**: "inform state-level policy interventions," "training the next generation"

### Interdisciplinary Emphasis ✅
Explicitly connects three domains:
- **Data Science**: "computational methods," "spatial data analysis," "statistical modeling"
- **Public Policy**: "urban policy research," "state-level policy interventions," "policy challenges"
- **Urban Studies**: "Urban and Civic Informatics Lab," "urban policy research"
