      <description>The new way to scan Ocean County Ocean County Radio Live is taking the technical complexity and hassle out of radio scanning in Ocean County, New Jersey. This website was launched in late January, 2018 and since that date has continued to stream &amp;amp; archive multiple police, fire &amp;amp; EMS radio channels.
This website is powered by the latest software defined radio (SDR) technology to process the streams of digital data produced by the Ocean County trunked radio system and also record analog conventional systems used by some departments &amp;amp; squads.</description>
