      <description>One year ago today, I launched OPRAmachine, and it has been making a significant impact on all levels of New Jersey government since its inception. OPRAmachine began with a simple premise: to maximize government transparency in New Jersey by automatically publishing public records requests &amp;amp; responses.
The site&amp;rsquo;s unique approach to public records helps individuals get answers to their personal OPRA requests, but also serves the entire community by contributing to a growing statewide archive of public knowledge.</description>

      <description>My work with OPRAmachine recently saw me interviewed by the newsletter of an organization that represents the interests of local and county utilities authorities around the state.
Eric San Juan, a writer for the Association of Environmental Authorities of New Jersey&amp;rsquo;s newsletter, interviewed me earlier in the summer about the impact of my statewide freedom of information platform, OPRAmachine.
The AEA-NJ was interested in OPRAmachine because their member authorities are subject to the state&amp;rsquo;s freedom of information law, the New Jersey Open Public Records Act.</description>
