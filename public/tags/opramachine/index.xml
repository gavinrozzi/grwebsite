      <description>I am writing in response to Jonathan Frodella’s article that appeared in the January 17th, 2019 edition of the New Jersey Law Journal entitled “Victims of Serious Crimes Need More Protection Under OPRA.” Mr. Frodella - whose article was written from the perspective of an attorney that advises municipal clerks - contends that services that automatically publish public records requests and responses such as OPRAmachine, which I founded in 2017, serve to create a “complication” for custodians of records by not requiring individuals to certify whether or not they were convicted of an indictable offense due to the remote possibility of a convicted criminal requesting information about their victims.</description>

      <description>PRINCETON - I was interviewed by U.S. 1 News, publishers of the website PrincetonInfo this week. The interview appeared both online and in the website&amp;rsquo;s print newspapers, which are distributed in the Mercer County region.
From their article:
 Anyone who has ever tried to request government records in New Jersey knows that authorities and bureaucracies make the information request process intentionally difficult and inconvenient, to discourage the public from seeking information that is required by law to be public.</description>

      <description>One year ago today, I launched OPRAmachine, and it has been making a significant impact on all levels of New Jersey government since its inception. OPRAmachine began with a simple premise: to maximize government transparency in New Jersey by automatically publishing public records requests &amp;amp; responses.
The site&amp;rsquo;s unique approach to public records helps individuals get answers to their personal OPRA requests, but also serves the entire community by contributing to a growing statewide archive of public knowledge.</description>

      <description>My work with OPRAmachine recently saw me interviewed by the newsletter of an organization that represents the interests of local and county utilities authorities around the state.
Eric San Juan, a writer for the Association of Environmental Authorities of New Jersey&amp;rsquo;s newsletter, interviewed me earlier in the summer about the impact of my statewide freedom of information platform, OPRAmachine.
The AEA-NJ was interested in OPRAmachine because their member authorities are subject to the state&amp;rsquo;s freedom of information law, the New Jersey Open Public Records Act.</description>
