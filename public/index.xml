      <title>OPRAmachine: 1 Year Later</title>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;one-year-ago-today-i-launched-opramachine-https-opramachine-com-and-it-has-been-making-a-significant-impact-on-all-levels-of-new-jersey-government-since-its-inception&#34;&gt;One year ago today, I launched &lt;a href=&#34;https://opramachine.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;OPRAmachine&lt;/a&gt;, and it has been making a significant impact on all levels of New Jersey government since its inception.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OPRAmachine began with a simple premise: to maximize government transparency in New Jersey by automatically publishing public records requests &amp;amp; responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site&amp;rsquo;s unique approach to public records helps individuals get answers to their personal OPRA requests, but also serves the entire community by contributing to a growing statewide archive of public knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public records that normally would have been provided to just one requestor are now stored in perpetuity and infinitely accessible to others that may have an interest in them using the service, something that proprietary solutions like GovQA fail to adequately do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Jersey is a state that has been known for its many layers of government, with 565 municipalities and countless school districts, MUAs and other independent authorities. OPRAmachine makes navigating the various layers of government simple for both those new to requesting public records and those with experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than hunting for email addresses on town websites or dealing with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www16.state.nj.us/NJ_OPRA/department.jsp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;poorly designed online systems that are relics of a bygone era in web design&lt;/a&gt;, OPRAmachine is realizing the dream of a single, unified &amp;amp; open platform for transparency in all 21 counties of the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first came up with the idea of creating a site like OPRAmachine in late 2016 and began working on testing and customizing the &lt;a href=&#34;https://alaveteli.org/deployments/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;open-source code&lt;/a&gt; that powers the site throughout 2017. By October of last year, we pulled back the curtain and let the public start making requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The early days of the site were wrought with technical challenges, and high demand in the first weeks resulted in OPRAmachine&amp;rsquo;s server being brought down multiple times. After overcoming those initial challenges, we were proud to have no major downtime during business hours that would have prevented responses to public records requests being received by our server.&lt;/p&gt;

Since October, 2017, OPRAmachine has seen:
&lt;ul&gt;
  
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2794&lt;/strong&gt; public records requests&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2079&lt;/strong&gt; followup messages sent&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;382&lt;/strong&gt; registered users&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;934&lt;/strong&gt; public bodies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;99&lt;/strong&gt; annotations added to requests&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;241&lt;/strong&gt; tracked requests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the days and months that followed the launch, the site has since taken on a life of its own, and I continue to be impressed by the new use cases that have emerged as more people began to adopt the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have an incredible, diverse group of users who have benefitted from the site. Our users represent a cross-section of the stakeholders that benefits from increased access to public information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They include attorneys, traditional &amp;amp; digital journalists, college professors, real estate &amp;amp; property management professionals, public officials, private investigators, environmental consultants and perhaps most importantly, private citizens interested in learning more about the inner workings of their state &amp;amp; local government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of our users have benefitted from OPRAmachine without even making a request of their own. Some receive email alerts for specific towns and keywords found in requests, while our full collection of documents is indexed by search engines like Google and often appears in their results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever their individual use case may be, the common thread among them has been that our paperless, streamlined process has simplified the public records request process while saving time &amp;amp; resources for all concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OPRAmachine could not have seen the level of success that is has without the support it has received from our stakeholders &amp;amp; community. I&amp;rsquo;d like to thank all of our users, especially our most persistent requestors as well as our volunteer administrator, Jeff Epstein, who has handled many issues with the site &amp;amp; inquiries from users when I am unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would also like to thank the government officials that have had a dialogue with me in the course of running the service &amp;amp; dealing with administrative issues. I found it heartening that many of the township clerks I engaged with appreciated the mission of the site and the increased transparency it provides residents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also deserving of recognition is our legal counsel, CJ Griffin, Esq. and Walters Luers, Esq. They have both been tremendous assets and we would be at a significant disadvantage without their expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I am optimistic about the success we have attained in just one short year, there are some significant hurdles that we still must overcome to ensure the continued success of OPRAmachine. Going forward, the challenge will be to educate certain &lt;a href=&#34;https://aeanj.org/wp-content/uploads/AEA-Authority-View-Summer-2018.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;reactionary government officials&lt;/a&gt; about the benefits of the service and advocating for legislative reform that favors electronic disclosure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is my goal to work with government agencies as much as we can, but when all else fails, we will pursue litigation against those government agencies that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gavinrozzi.com/post/monmouth-opra-case/&#34;&gt;arbitrarily &amp;amp; unlawfully refuse to process requests&lt;/a&gt; on the basis that they are submitted through the site, and encourage our users to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In closing, we&amp;rsquo;ve covered a lot of ground during the first year of OPRAmachine&amp;rsquo;s existence, but our work is far from over. Thank you all of those who have supported us on this journey.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interview with Jersey Shore Online Re: Monmouth County OPRAmachine Lawsuit</title>
      <link>https://www.gavinrozzi.com/post/monmouth-opra-case/</link>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-recently-spoke-with-jersey-shore-online-https-www-jerseyshoreonline-com-ocean-county-lawsuit-questions-when-county-can-share-public-records-about-my-participation-in-a-multi-plaintiff-open-public-records-act-lawsuit-against-the-monmouth-county-nj-government-over-their-refusal-to-answer-requests-through-my-site-opramachine-https-opramachine-com&#34;&gt;I recently spoke with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jerseyshoreonline.com/ocean-county/lawsuit-questions-when-county-can-share-public-records/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Jersey Shore Online&lt;/a&gt; about my participation in a multi-plaintiff Open Public Records Act lawsuit against the Monmouth County, NJ government over their refusal to answer requests through my site &lt;a href=&#34;https://opramachine.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;OPRAmachine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit stems from the county&amp;rsquo;s refusal to answer legally valid public records requests submitted through the site, which automatically publishes public records requests &amp;amp; responses in all 21 counties of New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its first year of existence, the civic technology and open government website - the first of its kind targeting New Jersey state &amp;amp; local government - has streamlined and modernized the public records request process in a paperless and easy to use process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monmouth County answered requests through the site without issue throughout 2017 and most of 2018 &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.opramachine.com/monmouth-opra-lawsuit/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;until one of their employees failed to redact confidential information.&lt;/a&gt;. When the county employees made a mistake, I took swift corrective action to remove the confidential material within 1 day of being contacted about the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the county chose to punish users of my site and refuse to answer any requests through the site after the incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is unaccaptable and an obstruction of the county&amp;rsquo;s transparency obligations under OPRA, the state&amp;rsquo;s freedom of information law. I joined in the case to stand up for our users, who have faced stalls and delays on their records requests. OPRAmachine users includ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the portion of the story where I was quoted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since announcing the lawsuit at the end of September, Rozzi has been working on changes to OPRAmachine. In an Oct. 9 email to Jersey Shore Online, he explained he’s been working to address privacy concerns raised by Monmouth County.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“By the end of the month, we anticipate that our changes will allow OPRAmachine to detect and automatically redact social security numbers to protect privacy interests, something that no other proprietary public records solution (that we are aware of in NJ) does,” Rozzi wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a separate email the same day, Rozzi explained exactly why he filed suit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We want the court to order Monmouth County to do as they have previously done and honor the legally valid public records requests submitted to them by our users. We hope that the lawsuit will stop the county from treating public records requests differently because they originate from the OPRAmachine service. To remedy the county’s obstruction of the public records request process, we are urging the court to strike down the county’s unprecedented and overreaching policy that limits access to public information and find them in violation of the law.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>OPRAmachine Webinar at Montclair</title>

&lt;/div&gt;

&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, August 21st, 2018 I made my way up to the Montclair University Center for Cooperative Media to present about my work creating the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gavinrozzi.com/projects/opramachine/&#34;&gt;OPRAmachine&lt;/a&gt; New Jersey statewide freedom of information portal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The webinar was attended by both journalists and other individuals interested in making use of the advanced public records research capabilities provided by our platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you to the folks at the Center who helped put all of this together, and thank you to our attendees who asked insightful questions!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Video: Defeating redactions on poorly redacted documents</title>
      <link>https://www.gavinrozzi.com/post/redactions/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Aug 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/0NnuA8RMyiY&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re like me and frequently deal with requesting public records, then you&amp;rsquo;ll be accustomed to receiving documents that have blocks of text redacted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Redactions are most often used by government officials to apply exemptions to the various federal and state public records law. Often, they&amp;rsquo;ll be used to obscure information that may breach confidentiality protections or needlessly harm the personal privacy of individuals. In other instances, redactions are somtimes abused to keep the lid on politically damaging revelations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all redactions are created equal. In most cases, public entities are able to suitably redact documents either using computer-based solutions or with a good old fashioned black marker and copy machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes public entities get it wrong and end up using programs such as Microsoft Office or other basic editors that weren&amp;rsquo;t designed with permanently removing redacted information in mind, which allows the digitial files to be edited to reveal the information that was intended to be kept hidden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Flordia, a newspaper recently took a document that was publicly posted on an official websited and used computer software to remove the redactions and report on the confidential information contained in the publicly available report regarding Parkland school shooter Nikolas Cruz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Florida judge who presided over public records litigation concerning the original release of the report quickly blasted the newspaper, and demonstrated technical ignorance with regard to how the details were obtained by the newspaper&amp;rsquo;s reporters. School board lawyers attempted to frame the publication of the information as a violation of a previous court order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video of the judge&amp;rsquo;s remarks was quickly posted to social media, where it circulated:
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Tough to watch. &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/7sSD40Wa5o&#34;&gt;https://t.co/7sSD40Wa5o&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Gavin Rozzi (@gavroz) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/gavroz/status/1030224010532057089?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;August 16, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my own video embedded above in this blog post, I use one of my own past public records requests to demonstrate how removing redactions and accessing hidden material is possible when public officials improperly attempt to redact information. The video shows the end result of me using Adobe Acrobat to delete the black boxes of text used to &amp;ldquo;redact&amp;rdquo; information from email logs provided in response to a 2017 public records request from a New Jersey school district.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these instances are not common, journalists owe it to themselves to double check the documents that they receive in response to their public records requests, as sometimes the mistakes of government agencies may work to the benefit of your story.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interview with AEA-NJ Newsletter</title>
      <link>https://www.gavinrozzi.com/post/aea-nj-interview/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Aug 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.gavinrozzi.com/post/aea-nj-interview/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My work with OPRAmachine recently saw me interviewed by the newsletter of an organization that represents the interests of local and county utilities authorities around the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eric San Juan, a writer for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.aeanj.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Association of Environmental Authorities of New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s newsletter, interviewed me earlier in the summer about the impact of my statewide freedom of information platform, OPRAmachine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AEA-NJ was interested in OPRAmachine because their member authorities are subject to the state&amp;rsquo;s freedom of information law, the New Jersey Open Public Records Act. Many of those authorities have been receiving requests through OPRAmachine and the interview provided an opportunity to communicate my platform&amp;rsquo;s benefits to citizens, public officials and other stakeholders with an interest in obtaining public records from New Jersey state and local government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article and interview were written from the perspective of member authorities and how OPRAmachine may impact them. It also included commentary from a public official who expressed their personal opinions about the site and compliance with New Jersey&amp;rsquo;s OPRA law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://aeanj.org/wp-content/uploads/AEA-Authority-View-Summer-2018.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The full article&lt;/a&gt; appears in the AEA-NJ&amp;rsquo;s summer, 2018 edition of their &amp;ldquo;Authority View&amp;rdquo; newsletter, which is accessible to member municipal and county utilities authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Article preview:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here is their official announcement of the event, copied below:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Opening up New Jersey government, one request at a time.&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s the tagline of OPRAmachine.com, a free tool created by New Jersey&amp;rsquo;s own Gavin Rozzi and available for all to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every citizen has the right to access public records held by state &amp;amp; local government agencies under the New Jersey Open Public Records Act (OPRA). By law, they have to respond. The problem is, the process for requesting those documents isn&amp;rsquo;t always as easy and straightforward as it should be – until now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join this webinar and Rozzi will show you the simple, step-by-step process for filing OPRA requests and browsing OPRAmachine to see what public records and information others have requested&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Big upgrades to OC Radio Live</title>
      <link>https://www.gavinrozzi.com/post/ocrl-update-72918/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Today I am proud to announce that we have added a significant number of new channels to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ocradio.live&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ocean County Radio Live&lt;/a&gt;, my online police fire &amp;amp; EMS scanner and archive service.
The service now supports listening to two 700 MHz digital trunked radio systems, Ocean County&amp;rsquo;s and the New Jersey Interoperability Communications System, which hosts channels for the State Police,
Fish &amp;amp; Wildlife and numerous other state and local agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding these new systems to our service is important because many people are missing out on listening to these systems because of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2LJX7TX&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;high price&lt;/a&gt; of purchasing a new scanner,
along with the technical complexity of programming the scanner. My service eliminates both of these problems, while adding several exciting new features that make scanning even better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In partnership with &lt;a href=&#34;https://ocscanner.news/2018/07/29/ocsn-scanner-less-dispatchers-wanted/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ocean County Scanner News&lt;/a&gt; we have made significant infrastructure and server upgrades to support the addition of more channels through the purchase of additional software defined radios.
We hope to have additional channels added soon, along with restoring our coverage of the barrier island, Toms River and Brick, which had to be temporarily taken offline to make room for the 700 MHz upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it goes without saying that there is a cost to provide this service. We would like to thank all those who have purchased a premium subscription, as it directly support additional upgrades.
Please consider purhasing a &lt;a href=&#34;https://ocradio.live/plans/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;premium archive access plan&lt;/a&gt; to listen our archives and support the development of OC Radio Live, or consider &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.patreon.com/gavinrozzi&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;supporting me on Patreon&lt;/a&gt; to enable future public service web development &amp;amp; transparency projects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>OPRAmachine update: The $1000 email metadata &amp; other pushback from government agencies</title>
      <link>https://www.gavinrozzi.com/post/621-om-update/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was once again interviewed by &lt;a href=&#34;https://citizensmedia.tv/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Citizens&amp;rsquo; Media TV&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; Jeff Epstein about my work with public records &amp;amp; transparency via the OPRAmachine statwewide freedom of information portal that I run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Epstein serves as one of the site&amp;rsquo;s volunteer administrators and in this podcast recorded on June 21st, 2018 we discuss some of the challenges that we have encountered running the site, including pushback from government agencies, fee demands for public records &amp;amp; more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen to the full interview:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rozzi v. Office of the Attorney General</title>
      <link>https://www.gavinrozzi.com/project/rozzivoag/</link>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;attorney-general-s-office-violated-public-records-law-by-witholding-email-logs&#34;&gt;Attorney General&amp;rsquo;s Office violated public records law by witholding email logs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legal Counsel: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pashmanstein.com/attorney/cj-griffin&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CJ Griffin, Esq.&lt;/a&gt; - Pashman Stein Walder Hayden&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New Jersey Attorney General&amp;rsquo;s Office was found to have violated the Open Public Records Act by denying my request for copies of email logs for the OAG&amp;rsquo;s custodian of records. I requested the email logs as a part of my advocacy on behalf of my statewide freedom of information website, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gavinrozzi.com/project/opramachine/&#34;&gt;OPRAmachine&lt;/a&gt;. The email logs provided insight into the practices of OAG when it comes to handling OPRA requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;question-presented&#34;&gt;Question Presented&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was the New Jersey Attorney General&amp;rsquo;s Office&amp;rsquo;s denial of a request for copies for email logs - on the basis that all of the logs should be withheld because a portion contained confidential information - a violation of the Open Public Records Act, N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1 et seq.?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;holding&#34;&gt;Holding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judge Mary Jacobson, A.J.S.C. held that the Attorney General&amp;rsquo;s refusal to produce the logs as originally requested constituted a violation of OPRA and ordered the OAG to disclose the requested email logs that were responsive to the initial public records request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;outcome&#34;&gt;Outcome&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Attorney General&amp;rsquo;s office eventually complied with the court order and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gavinrozzi.com/post/rozzi-oag/&#34;&gt;turned over the responsive email logs.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the interest of saving resources, I voluntarily waived the portions of the email logs that did not pertain to the deputy attorney general&amp;rsquo;s other roles outside of complying with the state&amp;rsquo;s Open Public Records Act in order to prevent any further delays to accessing the requested public records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;case-documents&#34;&gt;Case documents&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gavinrozzi.com/files/Rozzi-AG Verified Complaint.pdf&#34;&gt;Read my verified complaint&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gavinrozzi.com/post/rozzi-oag/&#34;&gt;Read my blog post about the documents they released&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Document Production in Rozzi v. OAG</title>
      <link>https://www.gavinrozzi.com/post/rozzi-oag/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 May 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.gavinrozzi.com/post/rozzi-oag/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently obtained &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gavinrozzi.com/files/OAGemaillogs.pdf&#34;&gt;the following documents&lt;/a&gt; from the New Jersey Attorney General&amp;rsquo;s Office (OAG) which were produced in response to a court order isued in my lawsuit against the OAG. The documents were copies of email logs that show messages sent and received by the OAG&amp;rsquo;s custodian of records, who is responsible for complying with the provision of the New Jersey Open Public Records Act (OPRA) by way of responding to requests made under the state freedom of information law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gavinrozzi.com/files/Rozzi-AG Verified Complaint.pdf&#34;&gt;My lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, which was filed in Mercer County Superior Court, resulted in an an order for the Attorney General&amp;rsquo;s office to produce the (redacted) copies of the documents that I originally requested back in November, 2017. Additional delays were added by the fact that the documents required a significant number of redactions due to the OPRA custodian&amp;rsquo;s additional responsibilities in the OAG, such as those related to homeland security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My attorney, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pashmanstein.com/attorney/cj-griffin&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CJ Griffin, Esq.&lt;/a&gt; ultimately prevailed over the creative legal argument advanced by the AG&amp;rsquo;s Office. The AG&amp;rsquo;s legal position was particularly novel because the legal briefings cited OPRA cases as old as 2004 while essentially attempting to pretend the New Jersey Supreme Court&amp;rsquo;s ruling in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/03/nj_supreme_court_ruling_could_reshape_what_governm.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Paff v. Galloway Township&lt;/a&gt; (2017) never happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;I have an &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/OPRA?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#OPRA&lt;/a&gt; hearing tomorrow. Last year our Supreme Court ruled in Paff v Galloway that a request for a log of emails is a valid OPRA request. The State refuses to follow it and is asking the court to apply case law from 2004, as if Paff never happened. Updates to come&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; CJ Griffin, Esq. (@CJGriffinEsq) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/CJGriffinEsq/status/983515006556934144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;April 10, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the documents that were recently produced by the OAG in response to Judge Mary Jacobson, A.J.S.C.&amp;rsquo;s ruling in this case are available on the original &lt;a href=&#34;https://opramachine.com/request/email_logs_for_bruce_solomon_oag#incoming-3248&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;request thread on OPRAmachine.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Conversation With Jeff Epstein and Patrick Duff Re: OPRA &amp; Open Government</title>
      <link>https://www.gavinrozzi.com/post/jeffpatrickopra/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently spoke with Citizens&amp;rsquo; Media TV&amp;rsquo;s Jeff Epstein and Patrick Duff for an audio interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/peopleconversations/omgavinpatrick&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Our conversation&lt;/a&gt; centered on the Open Public Records Act (OPRA), transparency &amp;amp; open government issues centered on my work with public records and how the three of us have made use of my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gavinrozzi.com/project/opramachine/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;OPRAmachine&lt;/a&gt; platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Epstein is an independent journalist who I&amp;rsquo;ve previously collaborated with on various projects, and he also has a role with OPRAmachine where has serves as one of the site&amp;rsquo;s administrators since its inception in 2017. He covers local and naitonal political issues and streams local government meetings on &lt;a href=&#34;https://citizensmedia.tv/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Citizens&amp;rsquo; Media TV.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Duff is one of the most active users of OPRAmachine, having used the site to file numerous public records agencies to state agencies as well as local governments primarily in Camden County. He explained how he is using OPRAmachine further his research into the historical significance of properties tied to Martin Luther King in southern New Jersey. He explained how he used the site to streamline and track all of the public records requests he files to support his historical research. One of the public records requests Duff filed through OPRAmachine resulted in a lawsuit against the City of Camden, which he largely prevailed in since the recording of this interview. All of Duff&amp;rsquo;s public records requests and documents provided by government agencies in response &lt;a href=&#34;https://opramachine.com/user/patrick_duff&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;can be viewed on the site here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Discussing OPRAmachine&#39;s Impact With WLFR Radio&#39;s Bill Watt</title>
      <link>https://www.gavinrozzi.com/post/watt-interview/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 08 Apr 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.gavinrozzi.com/post/watt-interview/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On on April 5th, 2018 I joined WLFR Radio&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Watt&amp;rsquo;s The Move&lt;/strong&gt;, Stocton University&amp;rsquo;show
own radio show that focuses on poliitics and public affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my one hour segment I discussed my work on several fronts. Our interview began with
talk of my work with my first and most successful project, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gavinrozzi.com/project/politicsoc/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ocean County Politics&lt;/a&gt;
and later pivoted to my work with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gavinrozzi.com/project/opramachine/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;OPRAmachine&lt;/a&gt; freedom of information portal and
how it is making New Jersey government more transparent as a result of its impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final segment of the show was spent discussing my analysis of the upcoming 2018 primary races, specifically with regard to the senate
and congressional seats that will be in play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WLFR is the student-run radio station of Stockton University, and broadcasts
in Galloway Township, NJ on 91.7 MHz and also has &lt;a href=&#34;http://wlfr.fm/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;a feed online&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See below for a video of me discussing OPRAmachine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;new-jersey-state-police-held-accountable-in-court-for-stalling-on-public-records-requests&#34;&gt;New Jersey State Police held accountable in court for stalling on public records requests&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case Libertarians for Transparent Government v. New Jersey State Police was an important case that revealed unacceptable practices by the New Jersey State Police.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case revealed a pattern and practice of failure to comply with the requirements of the state&amp;rsquo;s Open Public Records Act (OPRA) after a judge in the case issued a ruling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I participated in the case by way of filing a certification detailing my experience with attempting to obtain helicopter usage logs
for then-New Jersey Governor Chris Christie&amp;rsquo;s usage of State Police helicopters. My certification details my own experience with the State Police and how they took repeated extensions prior to providing me with heavily redacted helicopter usage records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;case-documents&#34;&gt;Case documents&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gavinrozzi.com/files/Cert of Gavin Rozzi for Libertarians-SP2.pdf&#34;&gt;Read my certification&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
