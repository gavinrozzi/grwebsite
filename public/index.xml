      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ocradio.live/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ocean County Radio Live&lt;/a&gt; is taking the technical complexity and hassle out of scanning in Ocean County, New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This website uses software defined radio (SDR) technology to process the streams of digital data produced by the Ocean County trunked radio system. The SDRs record radio transmissions and upload them to the site&amp;rsquo;s server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ocean County Radio Live is based on the open-source &amp;ldquo;trunk-player&amp;rdquo; application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New Jersey Government Records Council (GRC) ruled in my favor and ordered the
Lacey Township Board of Education to refund an $85 &amp;ldquo;special service fee&amp;rdquo; they attempted
to charge me for copies of checks that showed the board&amp;rsquo;s contracted attorney was receiving health benefits through a school plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;New Jersey Government Records Council&lt;/strong&gt; (GRC) ruled in my favor and declared that the
response provided to an Open Public Records Act (OPRA) request was legally insufficient under the OPRA law&amp;rsquo;s requirements. The GRC complaint was filed in 2015 and was adjudicated by the GRC after a nearly two-year wait time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This case was filed at the same time a lawsuit that was filed against the OCPO by open government activist Harry Scheeler. Scheeler&amp;rsquo;s lawsuit sought similar documents as those that were issue in this case.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During the 2016 presidential election, I worked to fiercely cover the state, local &amp;amp; federal elections occurring within the communities of Ocean County, New Jersey for my website &lt;a href=&#34;https://politicsoc.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ocean County Politics&lt;/a&gt;. During this time, my reporting on the cancellation of a GOP fundraiser held for then-Vice Presidential candidate Mike Pence was featured on an episode of the Rachel Maddow.&lt;/p&gt;

Is lack of interest in Pence events a sign of the air leaving the Trump balloon?&lt;/p&gt;Posted by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/therachelmaddowshow/&#34;&gt;The Rachel Maddow Show&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, October 11, 2016&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>OPRAmachine</title>
      <link>https://www.gavinrozzi.com/project/opramachine/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://opramachine.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;OPRAmachine.com&lt;/a&gt; is a first of its kind government transparency project that I recently launched to serve the citizens of the state of New Jersey. The site is powered by the New Jersey &lt;strong&gt;Open Public Records Act&lt;/strong&gt; (OPRA), a freedom of information law that allows any citizen of the state to request public records from state and local government agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-it-works&#34;&gt;How it works&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OPRAmachine breaks down barriers by explaining aspects of the OPRA request process. The site allows any citizen to easily file a legally valid public records request and includes a directory that currently includes all 565 municipalities in the state, as well as various state and county governmental agencies. The site has enabled requesters to obtain thousands of pages worth of public records, helping to shine a light on some of the more obscure elements of New Jersey state and local government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A unique benefit that OPRAmachine provides is that once a public entity provides documents in response to a request, the documents are subsequently stored in the site&amp;rsquo;s database and made public, allowing the entire public to be able to reap the benefits. This model reduces duplicate requests and serves to further the OPRA law&amp;rsquo;s purpose of maximizing the citizenry&amp;rsquo;s knowledge of public affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site has been making an impact and has been used as a research tool by public officials, journalists and activists seeking to obtain authoritative information about public entities in the state. We recently added a &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.opramachine.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; that includes detailed information about the process of making a request through the site, as well as reference material concerning the legal and site administration issues that may arise as a result of the site&amp;rsquo;s operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://opramachine.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Check out OPRAmachine here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ocean County Scanner News</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ocscanner.news/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ocean County Scanner News &lt;/a&gt; is a network of radio and emergency services enthusiasts who listen to police scanners and post live news updates via their Facebook page. I designed the groups&amp;rsquo;s website
in addition to setting up a livestream server running the Icecast software package. The live feed covers
the Ocean County Trunked Radio system and several other local conventional channels. We are planning more
additions to the live feed as time and resources allow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the brief updates posted on Ocean County Scanner News are reflective of breaking news stories that later are reported in the media.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interview with CIO Magazine</title>
      <link>https://www.gavinrozzi.com/post/ciomag/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CIO Magazine &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cio.com/article/2460827/search/seo-sem-top-25-diy-tips-for-better-seo.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;wanted my take&lt;/a&gt; on tips you can take to improve search engine rankings for small business websites for an article entitled &amp;ldquo;Top 25 DIY Tips for Better SEO.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I had to say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress is, in essence, a blogging platform. But many businesses use it as the content management system for a complete website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoast’s WordPress SEO Plugin (free) is a favorite among many SEO experts. “I recommend it to my clients because it allows the automation and easy integration of important SEO strategies,” says Gavin Rozzi, president, Gavin Rozzi Technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drupal and Joomla are two worthy WordPress alternatives, Rozzi says. “These free, open-source content management systems come with an assortment of plug-ins that automate much of the SEO workload.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
