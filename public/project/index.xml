      <description>Attorney General&amp;rsquo;s Office violated public records law by witholding email logs Legal Counsel: CJ Griffin, Esq. - Pashman Stein Walder Hayden
The New Jersey Attorney General&amp;rsquo;s Office was found to have violated the Open Public Records Act by denying my request for copies of email logs for the OAG&amp;rsquo;s custodian of records.

      <description>Opening up New Jersey government OPRAmachine.com is a first of its kind government transparency project that I recently launched to serve the citizens of the state of New Jersey. The site is powered by the New Jersey Open Public Records Act (OPRA), a freedom of information law that allows any citizen of the state to request public records from state and local government agencies.
How it works OPRAmachine is breaking down barriers by explaining aspects of the OPRA request process.</description>
