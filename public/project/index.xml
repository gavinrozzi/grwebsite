      <description>Opening up New Jersey government OPRAmachine.com is a first of its kind government transparency project that I recently launched to serve the citizens of the state of New Jersey. The site is powered by the New Jersey Open Public Records Act (OPRA), a freedom of information law that allows any citizen of the state to request public records from state and local government agencies.
How it works OPRAmachine is breaking down barriers by explaining aspects of the OPRA request process.</description>

      <description>The new way to scan Ocean County Ocean County Radio Live is taking the technical complexity and hassle out of radio scanning in Ocean County, New Jersey. This website was launched in late January, 2018 and since that date has continued to stream &amp;amp; archive multiple police, fire &amp;amp; EMS radio channels.
This website is powered by the latest software defined radio (SDR) technology to process the streams of digital data produced by the Ocean County trunked radio system and also record analog conventional systems used by some departments &amp;amp; squads.</description>

      <description>The Toms River 911 Call Explorer is a small web development project that I created in the summer of 2018 order to make visualzing data that I obtained using an OPRA request.
Content on the website is rendered using the Hugo static site generator, with the request thread on OPRAmachine hosting the actual CSV file with 911 call data.
Columns from the CSV file are rendered on the homepage of the site after being pulled from OPRAmachine.</description>
