      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Forked River Amateur Radio Club is a new club recently formed to serve amateur radio community of Forked River, NJ and surrounding areas. I currently serve as both the vice president and webmaster of the club. We anticipate on pursuing several projects through this club, such as 2 meter FM repeater and 70 cm band DMR system to cover the Lacey area.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;OPRAmachine.com is a first of its kind government transparency project to launch in New Jersey. The site allows any citizen to easily file a legally valid public records request under New Jersey&amp;rsquo;s state freedom of information law, the Open Public Records Act (OPRA). The site has enabled requesters to obtain thousands of pages worth of public records, helping to shine a light on some of the more obscure elements of New Jersey state and local government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site has been making an impact and has been used as a research tool by public officials, journalists and activists seeking to obtain authoritative information about public entities in the state.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ocean County Scanner News is a network of radio and emergency services enthusiasts who listen to
police scanners and post live news updates via their Facebook page. I designed the groups&amp;rsquo;s website
in addition to setting up a livestream server running the Icecast software package. The live feed covers
the Ocean County Trunked Radio system and several other local conventional channels. We are planning more
additions to the live feed as time and resources allow.&lt;/p&gt;
