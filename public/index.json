[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" One year ago today, I launched OPRAmachine, and it has been making a significant impact on all levels of New Jersey government since its inception. OPRAmachine began with a simple premise: to maximize government transparency in New Jersey by automatically publishing public records requests \u0026amp; responses.\nThe site\u0026rsquo;s unique approach to public records helps individuals get answers to their personal OPRA requests, but also serves the entire community by contributing to a growing statewide archive of public knowledge.\nPublic records that normally would have been provided to just one requestor are now stored in perpetuity and infinitely accessible to others that may have an interest in them using the service, something that proprietary solutions like GovQA fail to adequately do.\nNew Jersey is a state that has been known for its many layers of government, with 565 municipalities and countless school districts, MUAs and other independent authorities. OPRAmachine makes navigating the various layers of government simple for both those new to requesting public records and those with experience.\nRather than hunting for email addresses on town websites or dealing with poorly designed online systems that are relics of a bygone era in web design, OPRAmachine is realizing the dream of a single, unified \u0026amp; open platform for transparency in all 21 counties of the state.\nI first came up with the idea of creating a site like OPRAmachine in late 2016 and began working on testing and customizing the open-source code that powers the site throughout 2017. By October of last year, we pulled back the curtain and let the public start making requests.\nThe early days of the site were wrought with technical challenges, and high demand in the first weeks resulted in OPRAmachine\u0026rsquo;s server being brought down multiple times. After overcoming those initial challenges, we were proud to have no major downtime during business hours that would have prevented responses to public records requests being received by our server.\nSince October, 2017, OPRAmachine has seen:  3016 public records requests 2166 followup messages sent 412 registered users 937 public bodies 110 annotations added to requests 254 tracked requests  In the days and months that followed the launch, the site has since taken on a life of its own, and I continue to be impressed by the new use cases that have emerged as more people began to adopt the site.\nWe have an incredible, diverse group of users who have benefitted from the site. Our users represent a cross-section of the stakeholders that benefits from increased access to public information.\nThey include attorneys, traditional \u0026amp; digital journalists, college professors, real estate \u0026amp; property management professionals, public officials, private investigators, environmental consultants and perhaps most importantly, private citizens interested in learning more about the inner workings of their state \u0026amp; local government.\nSome of our users have benefitted from OPRAmachine without even making a request of their own. Some receive email alerts for specific towns and keywords found in requests, while our full collection of documents is indexed by search engines like Google and often appears in their results.\nWhatever their individual use case may be, the common thread among them has been that our paperless, streamlined process has simplified the public records request process while saving time \u0026amp; resources for all concerned.\nOPRAmachine could not have seen the level of success that it has without the support it has received from our stakeholders \u0026amp; community. I\u0026rsquo;d like to thank all of our users, especially our most persistent requestors as well as our volunteer administrator, Jeff Epstein, who has handled many issues with the site \u0026amp; inquiries from users when I am unavailable.\nI would also like to thank the government officials that have had a dialogue with me in the course of running the service \u0026amp; dealing with administrative issues. I found it heartening that many of the township clerks I engaged with appreciated the mission of the site and the increased transparency it provides residents.\nAlso deserving of recognition is our legal counsel, CJ Griffin, Esq. and Walter Luers, Esq. They have both been tremendous assets and we would be at a significant disadvantage without their expertise.\nWhile I am optimistic about the success we have attained in just one short year, there are some significant hurdles that we still must overcome to ensure the continued success of OPRAmachine. Going forward, the challenge will be to educate certain reactionary government officials about the benefits of the service and advocating for legislative reform that favors electronic disclosure.\nIt is my goal to work with government agencies as much as we can, but when all else fails, we will pursue litigation against those government agencies that arbitrarily \u0026amp; unlawfully refuse to process requests on the basis that they are submitted through the site, and encourage our users to do the same.\nIn closing, we\u0026rsquo;ve covered a lot of ground during the first year of OPRAmachine\u0026rsquo;s existence, but our work is far from over. Thank you all of those who have supported us on this journey.\n","date":1540353600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1540353600,"objectID":"d5a21480fb3f15bdc7384f67b8eeb61a","permalink":"https://www.gavinrozzi.com/post/om-1-year-later/","publishdate":"2018-10-24T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/om-1-year-later/","section":"post","summary":"Reflections on how the site grew from 2017-18","tags":["OPRAmachine"],"title":"OPRAmachine: 1 Year Later","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" I recently spoke with Jersey Shore Online about my participation in a multi-plaintiff Open Public Records Act lawsuit against the Monmouth County, NJ government over their refusal to answer requests through my site OPRAmachine. The lawsuit stems from the county\u0026rsquo;s refusal to answer legally valid public records requests submitted through the site, which automatically publishes public records requests \u0026amp; responses in all 21 counties of New Jersey.\nIn its first year of existence, the civic technology and open government website - the first of its kind targeting New Jersey state \u0026amp; local government - has streamlined and modernized the public records request process in a paperless and easy to use process.\nMonmouth County answered requests through the site without issue throughout 2017 and most of 2018 until one of their employees failed to redact confidential information.. When the county employees made a mistake, I took swift corrective action to remove the confidential material within 1 day of being contacted about the issue.\nUnfortunately, the county chose to punish users of my site and refuse to answer any requests through the site after the incident.\nThis is unaccaptable and an obstruction of the county\u0026rsquo;s transparency obligations under OPRA, the state\u0026rsquo;s freedom of information law. I joined in the case to stand up for our users, who have faced stalls and delays on their records requests. OPRAmachine users includ\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the portion of the story where I was quoted:\n Since announcing the lawsuit at the end of September, Rozzi has been working on changes to OPRAmachine. In an Oct. 9 email to Jersey Shore Online, he explained he’s been working to address privacy concerns raised by Monmouth County.\n“By the end of the month, we anticipate that our changes will allow OPRAmachine to detect and automatically redact social security numbers to protect privacy interests, something that no other proprietary public records solution (that we are aware of in NJ) does,” Rozzi wrote.\nIn a separate email the same day, Rozzi explained exactly why he filed suit.\n“We want the court to order Monmouth County to do as they have previously done and honor the legally valid public records requests submitted to them by our users. We hope that the lawsuit will stop the county from treating public records requests differently because they originate from the OPRAmachine service. To remedy the county’s obstruction of the public records request process, we are urging the court to strike down the county’s unprecedented and overreaching policy that limits access to public information and find them in violation of the law.”\n Read the full story at Jersey Shore Online ","date":1539835200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1539835200,"objectID":"228149190c9be34cc028e441fb8c7f41","permalink":"https://www.gavinrozzi.com/post/monmouth-opra-case/","publishdate":"2018-10-18T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/monmouth-opra-case/","section":"post","summary":"Why we're suing Monmouth County","tags":null,"title":"Interview with Jersey Shore Online Re: Monmouth County OPRAmachine Lawsuit","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" I was honored to be included on the latest edition of Insider NJ\u0026rsquo;s Media 100 List ","date":1539144000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1539144000,"objectID":"396b97fc46431c8b366e0833ea02a765","permalink":"https://www.gavinrozzi.com/post/insider-100/","publishdate":"2018-10-10T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/insider-100/","section":"post","summary":"Joining the InsiderNJ Media 100 List","tags":null,"title":"'You have to read Rozzi'","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"   \u0026nbsp;\nOn Tuesday, August 21st, 2018 I made my way up to the Montclair University Center for Cooperative Media to present about my work creating the OPRAmachine New Jersey statewide freedom of information portal.\nThe webinar was attended by both journalists and other individuals interested in making use of the advanced public records research capabilities provided by our platform.\nThank you to the folks at the Center who helped put all of this together, and thank you to our attendees who asked insightful questions!\n","date":1534910400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1534910400,"objectID":"c8cdcc4475a691a036a041bd9ef516ae","permalink":"https://www.gavinrozzi.com/post/montclair-webinar/","publishdate":"2018-08-22T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/montclair-webinar/","section":"post","summary":"I presented a free webinar at Montclair University on streamlining public records requests","tags":["OPRAmachine"],"title":"OPRAmachine Webinar at Montclair","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"   \u0026nbsp;\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re like me and frequently deal with requesting public records, then you\u0026rsquo;ll be accustomed to receiving documents that have blocks of text redacted.\nRedactions are most often used by government officials to apply exemptions to the various federal and state public records law. Often, they\u0026rsquo;ll be used to obscure information that may breach confidentiality protections or needlessly harm the personal privacy of individuals. In other instances, redactions are somtimes abused to keep the lid on politically damaging revelations.\nNot all redactions are created equal. In most cases, public entities are able to suitably redact documents either using computer-based solutions or with a good old fashioned black marker and copy machine.\nSometimes public entities get it wrong and end up using programs such as Microsoft Office or other basic editors that weren\u0026rsquo;t designed with permanently removing redacted information in mind, which allows the digitial files to be edited to reveal the information that was intended to be kept hidden.\nIn Flordia, a newspaper recently took a document that was publicly posted on an official websited and used computer software to remove the redactions and report on the confidential information contained in the publicly available report regarding Parkland school shooter Nikolas Cruz.\nA Florida judge who presided over public records litigation concerning the original release of the report quickly blasted the newspaper, and demonstrated technical ignorance with regard to how the details were obtained by the newspaper\u0026rsquo;s reporters. School board lawyers attempted to frame the publication of the information as a violation of a previous court order.\nVideo of the judge\u0026rsquo;s remarks was quickly posted to social media, where it circulated: Tough to watch. https://t.co/7sSD40Wa5o\n\u0026mdash; Gavin Rozzi (@gavroz) August 16, 2018  In my own video embedded above in this blog post, I use one of my own past public records requests to demonstrate how removing redactions and accessing hidden material is possible when public officials improperly attempt to redact information.

My service eliminates both of these problems, while adding several exciting new features that make scanning even better.\nIn partnership with Ocean County Scanner News we have made significant infrastructure and server upgrades to support the addition of more channels through the purchase of additional software defined radios. We hope to have additional channels added soon, along with restoring our coverage of the barrier island, Toms River and Brick, which had to be temporarily taken offline to make room for the 700 MHz upgrades.\nFinally, it goes without saying that there is a cost to provide this service. We would like to thank all those who have purchased a premium subscription, as it directly support additional upgrades.

The site is powered by the New Jersey Open Public Records Act (OPRA), a freedom of information law that allows any citizen of the state to request public records from state and local government agencies.\nHow it works OPRAmachine is breaking down barriers by explaining aspects of the OPRA request process. The site allows any citizen to easily file a legally valid public records request and includes a directory that currently includes all 565 municipalities in the state, as well as various state and county governmental agencies. The site has enabled requesters to obtain thousands of pages worth of public records, helping to shine a light on some of the more obscure elements of New Jersey state and local government.\nA unique benefit that OPRAmachine provides is that once a public entity provides documents in response to a request, the documents are subsequently stored in the site\u0026rsquo;s database and made public, allowing the entire public to be able to reap the benefits. This model reduces duplicate requests and serves to further the OPRA law\u0026rsquo;s purpose of maximizing the citizenry\u0026rsquo;s knowledge of public affairs.\nThousands of pages released Since its inception in October, 2017, the OPRAmachine platform has enabled the release of thousands of pages of government documents. Our database of public bodoies currently includes all 565 municipalities in New Jersey, with more public bodies being added on a regular basis. The site has been making an impact and has been used as a research tool by public officials, journalists and activists seeking to obtain authoritative information about public entities in the state. We recently added a documentation that includes detailed information about the process of making a request through the site, as well as reference material concerning the legal and site administration issues that may arise as a result of the site\u0026rsquo;s operation.\nPraise for OPRAmachine \u0026ldquo;One of the most important tools making New Jersey government more transparent.\u0026rdquo; - Citizens Media TV\n\u0026ldquo;Thanks to Gavin Rozzi’s “OPRA Machine” website, the Atlantic County Government can no longer pretend to be transparent. Now they must do it for real.\u0026rdquo; - Atlantic County News\n\u0026ldquo;The latest installation of our Alaveteli software, OPRAmachine, is an interesting new use of the platform. Rather than covering a whole country, as most of the other Alaveteli installations around the world do, it services just a single US state.\u0026rdquo; - Gemma Moulder, of the UK-based mySociety, which created the open-source software that powers the OPRAmachine platform.\nOPRAmachine\u0026rsquo;s impact in New Jersey Following four months of work, I reflected on some of the accomplishments of the web service in this blog post.\nBy the numbers Since October, 2017, OPRAmachine has seen:  3016 public records requests 2166 followup messages sent 412 registered users 937 public bodies 110 annotations added to requests 254 tracked requests  Latest OPRA requests Powered by the OPRAmachine API\n Petitions forms for 2018 general electionRequested from: Bridgeton City\nRequested by: Nathan Goldschmidt\nStatus: Successful.Mr. Goldschmidt This has fulfilled your Opra request.

This website was launched in late January, 2018 and since that date has continued to stream \u0026amp; archive multiple police, fire \u0026amp; EMS radio channels.\nThis website is powered by the latest software defined radio (SDR) technology to process the streams of digital data produced by the Ocean County trunked radio system and also record analog conventional systems used by some departments \u0026amp; squads. The SDRs record radio transmissions and upload them to the site\u0026rsquo;s server, which allows them to easily be played and archived online. When Ocean County activates the new 700 MHz P25 Phase II radio system, our receivers will only need a simple software configuration change in order to pick up the new system\u0026rsquo;s signal. This flexibility makes SDR radios superior for this particular application, allowing us to provide a wide amount of channels on our system.\nThe system has a major advantage over all traditional forms of radio scanning as it uses \u0026ldquo;time shifting\u0026rdquo; like a DVR does when recording multiple overlapping TV shows, ensuring that no transmissions are missed, since traditional scanners can only hold on just one channel - potentially missing other calls that could be taking place on different talkgroups.\nThis system is powered by multiple R820T SDRs running on a desktop computer and connected to the front-end web server accessed by end users.\nAs our base of users continues to grow, I intend on covering more radio systems and adding them to this system.\nThe Ocean County Radio Live web application is based on the open-source Trunk-Player Django project. So far, I have contributed one pull request to the upstream open source software that powers the project, and I plan to contribute more in the future as my schedule allows.\nCurrent scan list lineup  Brick Fire \u0026amp; EMS Cape May County Delaware River Bridges Garden State Parkway Lacey Twp.
