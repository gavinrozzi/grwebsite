The Open Public Records Act (OPRA) states that “government records shall be readily accessible for inspection, copying, or examination by the citizens of this State, with certain exceptions, for the protection of the public interest.”\nUntil OPRAmachine: Fulfillment Like The Lawless Wild West Cities, towns, counties and other government entities can interpret how this service is to be implemented. So, until the arrival of OPRAmachine, fulfillment of this service was like the lawless Wild West: People would ask for information from local governments through a traditional paper process, and then hope their requests would be accepted, Rozzi said.\n Read the full story at NJ Tech Weekly\n","date":1556856000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556856000,"objectID":"4fd52379814645b57c50cd4b29ea4df9","permalink":"/post/njtech-interview/","publishdate":"2019-05-03T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/njtech-interview/","section":"post","summary":"I spoke with NJ Tech Weekly's Esther Surden on the impact of OPRAmachine","tags":["OPRAmachine","In the news"],"title":"Interview with NJ Tech Weekly","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" I am writing in response to Jonathan Frodella’s article that appeared in the January 17th, 2019 edition of the New Jersey Law Journal entitled “Victims of Serious Crimes Need More Protection Under OPRA.” Mr. Frodella - whose article was written from the perspective of an attorney that advises municipal clerks - contends that services that automatically publish public records requests and responses such as OPRAmachine, which I founded in 2017, serve to create a “complication” for custodians of records by not requiring individuals to certify whether or not they were convicted of an indictable offense due to the remote possibility of a convicted criminal requesting information about their victims.\n\u0026ldquo;Online services that automatically publish government records to the world have complicated this issue further by potentially reframing the analysis of victims’ privacy interests,\u0026rdquo; Frodella says.\nWhen I first launched the OPRAmachine service, our default request template included language that allowed individuals to certify whether or not they were convicted of an indictable offense. However, after discussing the necessity of including this certification with our legal team, we decided to remove it at their recommendation to protect the privacy interests of our requestors and in recognition of the fact that this is not a concern for the overwhelming majority of the thousands of public records requests that have been processed by our service.\nIndeed, OPRA does not limit the right of convicted felons to file OPRA requests. Even currently incarcerated inmates have a right to file OPRA requests. Therefore, there is no reason why a person would need to disclose their conviction status in order to obtain the overwhelming majority of government records. As such, including it on our forms would be extraneous.\nAs the OPRA statute is written now, N.J.S.A. 47:1A-2.2 might permit a government agency to ask the requestor about their conviction status given the context of their request. However, this should take place only in the rare circumstances where they need to ascertain whether the person was seeking records “pertaining to the person’s victim or the victim’s family.” Otherwise, there is no reason why a requestor would need to reveal whether or not they have a conviction history.\nAgainst that background, we chose to follow the advice of our legal team and drop the criminal conviction certifications from the default request template on OPRAmachine last year. So, while there may be potential concerns about the small chance of OPRA custodians releasing records to perpetrators of serious crimes, this is a concern that only applies to an infinitesimally small amount of requests. Records custodians should not throw the baby out with the bathwater and assume the worst about services that automatically publish public records online because of this remote possibility.\nIt is settled case law that the documents and records released by custodians of records are themselves government records subject to disclosure under our state freedom of information law. See Scheeler v. Office of the Governor, 448 N.J. Super. 333 (App. Div. 2017), so in line with the public policy of transparency codified in OPRA, there is absolutely no reason why public records requests and responses should not be published online for the benefit of the public.\nIn a perfect world, the innovative model adopted by OPRAmachine would be the default for all government agencies so that the public can be kept apprised of the activities of the bodies they support with their hard-earned tax dollars. That is what my work has centered on for the past two years.\nI created OPRAmachine in response to the dismal state of affairs for compliance with the Open Public Records Act in New Jersey. My own past experiences dealing with state \u0026amp; local government gone awry in my capacity as an independent journalist and transparency advocate have informed my opinions about the law’s implementation and state of compliance in New Jersey.\nFor a representative sample of some of the OPRA cases I was involved in where government agencies were found to have broken the law, see Rozzi v. Lacey Township Board of Education, GRC complaint 2015-224, Rozzi v. Ocean Cty. Prosecutor’s Office, GRC complaint 2015-250 and Libertarians for Transparent Government v. New Jersey State Police.\nDon’t just take my word for it: A 2015 study released by the Center for Public Integrity gave New Jersey a “D” grade in transparency and accountability and an \u0026ldquo;F\u0026rdquo; for public access to information.\nThat is unacceptable. Our state can and must do better, and right now OPRAmachine is one of the only platforms that is pushing back against the current lack of transparency and accountability in New Jersey government by publishing public records and tracking compliance with the law. Government agencies at all levels serve an important purpose by enforcing the law. It\u0026rsquo;s only fair that they comply with their statutory obligations to disclose public records under OPRA and respond to legally valid requests such as those facilitated by my service.\nAs a result of the activity on the site, we are producing the only statewide dataset that is tracking compliance with the law by type of government agency, including state offices, counties and independent authorities. Officials must be more proactive in fulfilling their transparency obligations to the public that they serve, and OPRAmachine is an important tool for remedying the current climate for transparency in the Garden State.\nThe thesis of Frodella’s commentary would make one think that there is an urgent problem affecting victims of crime. Contrary to his assertions, the sky is not falling for victim privacy. The truth of the matter is that the concerns raised by Mr. Frodella only apply to an exceptionally small number of requests. Records custodians are properly charged with the responsibility of determining whether a request is being submitted by an individual with a conviction seeking information pertaining to their victim(s). Additional exemptions are not necessary, nor should they be added in future iterations of OPRA reform bills pending in the legislature, as they risk diluting the effectiveness of OPRA as an accountability tool.\nWhile I am grateful for Mr. Frodella\u0026rsquo;s suggestion that agencies subject to OPRA be more \u0026ldquo;user friendly,\u0026rdquo; his advocacy of agencies emphasizing the use of official paper forms is problematic for those concerned with transparency. That remedy is at best anachronistic, and at worst, a way for local governments to be even less transparent by keeping public records requests hidden from the public at large, turning back the clock on recent advances if they were to be adopted.\nWhile Frodella says that government agencies should emphasize the use of official forms, he correctly stops short of advising governments that the use of an official form should be required. Forcing requestors to fill out a paper form is archaic, reactionary and a waste of paper as electronic records have become ubiquitous. Some records custodians attempt to ignore the court\u0026rsquo;s decision in Renna v. Cty. of Union, 407 N.J. Super. 230 (App. Div. 2009) and inaccurately claim that they will not process an OPRA request without an official form being completed.\nThe Appellate Division in Renna made it crystal clear that OPRA requests cannot be denied solely on the basis that they are not submitted on an agency\u0026rsquo;s official form. The OPRAmachine database has numerous examples of this, and fortunately, in many instances requestors pushed back against these additional bureaucratic hurdles erected by clerks to hinder access to public information.\nGovernment agencies must embrace the public policy considerations that have been enshrined in OPRA by taking steps to be proactively transparent. We must change the culture of government agencies from viewing OPRA as an unfunded mandate from Trenton. OPRA is an important check and balance and a vehicle for ensuring government accountability.\nFrodella also mentioned how the pending case Coombs et al. v. Cty. of Monmouth may impact OPRAmachine and other similar platforms. I joined as a plaintiff in the Coombs matter to stand up for the users of my platform who have been negatively impacted by the unprofessional behavior and bad faith exhibited by Monmouth County officials.\nThe Coombs matter made it to Monmouth County Superior Court\u0026rsquo;s docket when one of the county’s employees negligently failed to redact private information concerning County Prosecutor Christopher Grammicioni. Immediately upon being notified of the breach, we removed the documents upon being contacted by an assistant county counsel. Our stated terms of service request that government agencies put their reasons in writing for requesting the removal of documents, but we waived it due to exigency of the situation. There’s no denying that the entire situation could have been avoided had the county properly reviewed the documents before releasing them to the public.\nBy Monmouth County’s own admission in subsequent court filings, this incident was not the first time that county employees failed to properly redact OPRA documents. The only difference is that because OPRAmachine existed, the public was able to know that the breach had occurred.\nHow many other times have government agencies unwittingly compromised private information without the public having the benefit of knowing? That is the real question that should be asked here.\nThe Monmouth County government and its legal counsel instead chose to attempt to craft a new exemption by administrative fiat in response to the negligence and lack of care exercised by their employees, likely to save themselves future embarrassment and exercise additional control over the OPRA process as is typical in the capricious fiefdoms that have sprung up in New Jersey state \u0026amp; local government.\nAs our attorney Walter Luers wrote in a brief for the case \u0026ldquo;Attempts by public agencies to force records custodians to use specific forms or to make followup requests after they have been denied access to records or to limit the right to make a request to citizens of this State have failed. This case is no different.\u0026rdquo;\nTheir new legally specious OPRA policy says that the county will deny any OPRA request solely on the basis that the email address indicates the records will be automatically published on the internet. In addition to demonstrating an ignorance of how modern technology works, the policy adopted by Monmouth County contravenes both the letter and spirit of the Open Public Records Act.\nAdditionally, as the court observed in Asbury Park Press v. Ocean Cty. Prosecutor\u0026rsquo;s Office, 374 N.J. Super. 312 (Law. Div. 2004):\n Clearly, the court must always maintain a sharp focus on the purpose of OPRA and resist attempts to limit its scope, absent a clear showing that one of its exemptions or exceptions incorporated in the statute by reference is applicable to the requested disclosure. The salutary goal, simply put, is to maximize public knowledge about public affairs in order to ensure an informed citizenry and to minimize the evils inherent in a secluded process.\n This, the county cannot do, so both myself and another administrator of the site joined as plaintiffs in OPRAmachine user Jennifer Coombs\u0026rsquo; lawsuit to ensure that the Monmouth County government cannot be permitted to shirk their responsibility to comply with the law just because they don\u0026rsquo;t like the fact that public records requests are being shared with the very public they exist to serve.\nThere is no recognized legal precedent that supports the gravamen of the legal theory advanced by Monmouth County to justify their policy, which is an unprecedented blow to transparency in county government and as such, this policy perpetuates a manifest injustice to users of OPRAmachine and those similarly situated.\nIn conclusion, transparency and accountability are both vital to ensuring the health of a thriving democracy, both locally and nationally. Government agencies must fulfill their disclosure obligations so that voters may be fully informed when voting in elections and be knowledgeable of the activities of local officials who govern on their behalf. When they fail to do so, they do a disservice not only to their citizens, but to the values that our nation was founded on.\nAs I pledged in my press release announcing our case against Monmouth County last fall, our team is prepared to mount a campaign of litigation against any agency that challenges the validity of requests submitted through the OPRAmachine service.\n","date":1552107600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552107600,"objectID":"b7cddb275a946e369dbb7f4ff8bffa79","permalink":"/post/njlawjournal-response/","publishdate":"2019-03-09T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/njlawjournal-response/","section":"post","summary":"Responding to an attorney's commentary about OPRAmachine's impact on crime victim privacy","tags":["OPRAmachine","In the news"],"title":"Response to NJ Law Journal Article","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" PRINCETON - I was interviewed by U.S. 1 News, publishers of the website PrincetonInfo this week.

The award is issued to journalists who “…used new and emerging technologies or strategies to enhance and improve the value and impact of their reporting efforts.”\nThe award was given for our work with OPRAmachine, a statewide website that helps people submit public records requests to government agencies throughout New Jersey. The site’s innovative approach to government transparency features the automatic publication of public records requests and responses made to government agencies throughout New Jersey.\nSince the website has launched, it has processed over 4000 public records requests made to 963 government agencies within the state. Its freely searchable archive features 16 gigabytes of documents obtained from requests.\n“Gavin and his team added all 565 municipalities and 21 counties to their OPRAmachine database and then pursued educational and advocacy partnerships to improve and increase the service’s impact across the state,” said Joe Amditis, Associate Director of the Center for Cooperative Media at Montclair University.\nThe website, which has thousands of active users, includes features for auditing government agencies for their compliance with OPRA’s 7-day deadline for responses to requests.\nOcean County Politics Editor Gavin Rozzi “Rozzi and his team also hosted a free webinar for NJ News Commons partners where they trained journalists and other stakeholders on how to maximize the efficiency of their public records requests using OPRAmachine,” Amditis added. The webinar can be viewed for free online.\nIn 2018, a Pro tier was launched to support the rapid growth of the OPRAmachine service. Our partners in the construction / property management, legal \u0026amp; private investigative industries have quickly adopted the system to streamline their requests. We have also received positive feedback from multiple municipal clerks in Monmouth \u0026amp; Ocean Counties.\n“We are truly honored to receive this recognition for our government transparency platform,” Rozzi said in a statement. “The health of our democracy and society requires that public agencies fulfill their obligation to be transparent. Decisions that impact taxpayers need to be done in a public process, and I am thankful that our service has made a positive impact in empowering citizens by restoring transparency \u0026amp; accountability to New Jersey government.”\nRozzi would like to acknowledge Jeff Epstein, the editor of Citizens Media TV who has served as a volunteer administrator for the site, in addition to OPRAmachine assistant and OCP Staff Writer Carlie Gibson, who spearheaded efforts to update the site’s database with additional school districts.\nHe also would like to thank Charlie Kratovil, a former New Brunswick mayoral candidate and the editor of New Brunswick Today. Kratovil has been an early supporter of both Ocean County Politics and OPRAmachine, and we will be bringing him on as an administrator of OPRAmachine later this month.

OPRAmachine makes navigating the various layers of government simple for both those new to requesting public records and those with experience.\nRather than hunting for email addresses on town websites or dealing with poorly designed online systems that are relics of a bygone era in web design, OPRAmachine is realizing the dream of a single, unified \u0026amp; open platform for transparency in all 21 counties of the state.\nI first came up with the idea of creating a site like OPRAmachine in late 2016 and began working on testing and customizing the open-source code that powers the site throughout 2017. By October of last year, we pulled back the curtain and let the public start making requests.\nThe early days of the site were wrought with technical challenges, and high demand in the first weeks resulted in OPRAmachine\u0026rsquo;s server being brought down multiple times. After overcoming those initial challenges, we were proud to have no major downtime during business hours that would have prevented responses to public records requests being received by our server.\nSince October, 2017, OPRAmachine has seen: \n7038 public records requests 4262 followup messages sent 1130 registered users 1147 public bodies 151 annotations added to requests 516 tracked requests \nIn the days and months that followed the launch, the site has since taken on a life of its own, and I continue to be impressed by the new use cases that have emerged as more people began to adopt the site.\nWe have an incredible, diverse group of users who have benefitted from the site. Our users represent a cross-section of the stakeholders that benefits from increased access to public information.\nThey include attorneys, traditional \u0026amp; digital journalists, college professors, real estate \u0026amp; property management professionals, public officials, private investigators, environmental consultants and perhaps most importantly, private citizens interested in learning more about the inner workings of their state \u0026amp; local government.\nSome of our users have benefitted from OPRAmachine without even making a request of their own. Some receive email alerts for specific towns and keywords found in requests, while our full collection of documents is indexed by search engines like Google and often appears in their results.\nWhatever their individual use case may be, the common thread among them has been that our paperless, streamlined process has simplified the public records request process while saving time \u0026amp; resources for all concerned.\nOPRAmachine could not have seen the level of success that it has without the support it has received from our stakeholders \u0026amp; community. I\u0026rsquo;d like to thank all of our users, especially our most persistent requestors as well as our volunteer administrator, Jeff Epstein, who has handled many issues with the site \u0026amp; inquiries from users when I am unavailable.\nI would also like to thank the government officials that have had a dialogue with me in the course of running the service \u0026amp; dealing with administrative issues. I found it heartening that many of the township clerks I engaged with appreciated the mission of the site and the increased transparency it provides residents.\nAlso deserving of recognition is our legal counsel, CJ Griffin, Esq. and Walter Luers, Esq. They have both been tremendous assets and we would be at a significant disadvantage without their expertise.\nWhile I am optimistic about the success we have attained in just one short year, there are some significant hurdles that we still must overcome to ensure the continued success of OPRAmachine. Going forward, the challenge will be to educate certain reactionary government officials about the benefits of the service and advocating for legislative reform that favors electronic disclosure.\nIt is my goal to work with government agencies as much as we can, but when all else fails, we will pursue litigation against those government agencies that arbitrarily \u0026amp; unlawfully refuse to process requests on the basis that they are submitted through the site, and encourage our users to do the same.\nIn closing, we\u0026rsquo;ve covered a lot of ground during the first year of OPRAmachine\u0026rsquo;s existence, but our work is far from over. Thank you all of those who have supported us on this journey.\n","date":1540353600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1540353600,"objectID":"d5a21480fb3f15bdc7384f67b8eeb61a","permalink":"/post/om-1-year-later/","publishdate":"2018-10-24T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/om-1-year-later/","section":"post","summary":"Reflections on how the site grew from 2017-18","tags":["OPRAmachine"],"title":"OPRAmachine: 1 Year Later","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" I recently spoke with Jersey Shore Online about my participation in a multi-plaintiff Open Public Records Act lawsuit against the Monmouth County, NJ government over their refusal to answer requests through my site OPRAmachine. The lawsuit stems from the county\u0026rsquo;s refusal to answer legally valid public records requests submitted through the site, which automatically publishes public records requests \u0026amp; responses in all 21 counties of New Jersey.\nIn its first year of existence, the civic technology and open government website - the first of its kind targeting New Jersey state \u0026amp; local government - has streamlined and modernized the public records request process in a paperless and easy to use process.\nMonmouth County answered requests through the site without issue throughout 2017 and most of 2018 until one of their employees failed to redact confidential information.. When the county employees made a mistake, I took swift corrective action to remove the confidential material within 1 day of being contacted about the issue.\nUnfortunately, the county chose to punish users of my site and refuse to answer any requests through the site after the incident.\nThis is unaccaptable and an obstruction of the county\u0026rsquo;s transparency obligations under OPRA, the state\u0026rsquo;s freedom of information law. I joined in the case to stand up for our users, who have faced stalls and delays on their records requests. OPRAmachine users includ\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the portion of the story where I was quoted:\n Since announcing the lawsuit at the end of September, Rozzi has been working on changes to OPRAmachine. In an Oct. 9 email to Jersey Shore Online, he explained he’s been working to address privacy concerns raised by Monmouth County.\n“By the end of the month, we anticipate that our changes will allow OPRAmachine to detect and automatically redact social security numbers to protect privacy interests, something that no other proprietary public records solution (that we are aware of in NJ) does,” Rozzi wrote.\nIn a separate email the same day, Rozzi explained exactly why he filed suit.\n“We want the court to order Monmouth County to do as they have previously done and honor the legally valid public records requests submitted to them by our users. We hope that the lawsuit will stop the county from treating public records requests differently because they originate from the OPRAmachine service. To remedy the county’s obstruction of the public records request process, we are urging the court to strike down the county’s unprecedented and overreaching policy that limits access to public information and find them in violation of the law.”\n Read the full story at Jersey Shore Online ","date":1539835200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1539835200,"objectID":"228149190c9be34cc028e441fb8c7f41","permalink":"/post/monmouth-opra-case/","publishdate":"2018-10-18T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/monmouth-opra-case/","section":"post","summary":"Why we're suing Monmouth County for violating OPRA","tags":["OPRAmachine","Legal","In the news"],"title":"Interview with Jersey Shore Online Re: Monmouth County OPRAmachine Lawsuit","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" I was honored to be included on the latest edition of Insider NJ\u0026rsquo;s Media 100 List ","date":1539144000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1539144000,"objectID":"396b97fc46431c8b366e0833ea02a765","permalink":"/post/insider-100/","publishdate":"2018-10-10T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/insider-100/","section":"post","summary":"Joining the InsiderNJ Media 100 List","tags":["Ocean County Politics","In the news"],"title":"'You have to read Rozzi'","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"   \u0026nbsp;\nOn Tuesday, August 21st, 2018 I made my way up to the Montclair University Center for Cooperative Media to present about my work creating the OPRAmachine New Jersey statewide freedom of information portal.\nThe webinar was attended by both journalists and other individuals interested in making use of the advanced public records research capabilities provided by our platform.\nThank you to the folks at the Center who helped put all of this together, and thank you to our attendees who asked insightful questions!\n","date":1534910400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1534910400,"objectID":"c8cdcc4475a691a036a041bd9ef516ae","permalink":"/post/montclair-webinar/","publishdate":"2018-08-22T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/montclair-webinar/","section":"post","summary":"I presented a free webinar at Montclair University on streamlining public records requests","tags":["OPRAmachine"],"title":"OPRAmachine Webinar at Montclair","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"   \u0026nbsp;\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re like me and frequently deal with requesting public records, then you\u0026rsquo;ll be accustomed to receiving documents that have blocks of text redacted.\nRedactions are most often used by government officials to apply exemptions to the various federal and state public records law. Often, they\u0026rsquo;ll be used to obscure information that may breach confidentiality protections or needlessly harm the personal privacy of individuals. In other instances, redactions are somtimes abused to keep the lid on politically damaging revelations.\nNot all redactions are created equal. In most cases, public entities are able to suitably redact documents either using computer-based solutions or with a good old fashioned black marker and copy machine.\nSometimes public entities get it wrong and end up using programs such as Microsoft Office or other basic editors that weren\u0026rsquo;t designed with permanently removing redacted information in mind, which allows the digitial files to be edited to reveal the information that was intended to be kept hidden.\nIn Flordia, a newspaper recently took a document that was publicly posted on an official websited and used computer software to remove the redactions and report on the confidential information contained in the publicly available report regarding Parkland school shooter Nikolas Cruz.\nA Florida judge who presided over public records litigation concerning the original release of the report quickly blasted the newspaper, and demonstrated technical ignorance with regard to how the details were obtained by the newspaper\u0026rsquo;s reporters. School board lawyers attempted to frame the publication of the information as a violation of a previous court order.\nVideo of the judge\u0026rsquo;s remarks was quickly posted to social media, where it circulated: Tough to watch. https://t.co/7sSD40Wa5o\n\u0026mdash; Gavin Rozzi (@gavroz) August 16, 2018  In my own video embedded above in this blog post, I use one of my own past public records requests to demonstrate how removing redactions and accessing hidden material is possible when public officials improperly attempt to redact information.

Details about the award are available here. Opening up New Jersey government OPRAmachine.com is a first of its kind government transparency project that I recently launched to serve the citizens of the state of New Jersey. The site is powered by the New Jersey Open Public Records Act (OPRA), a freedom of information law that allows any citizen of the state to request public records from state and local government agencies.\nHow it works OPRAmachine is breaking down barriers by explaining aspects of the OPRA request process. The site allows any citizen to easily file a legally valid public records request and includes a directory that currently includes all 565 municipalities in the state, as well as various state and county governmental agencies. The site has enabled requesters to obtain thousands of pages worth of public records, helping to shine a light on some of the more obscure elements of New Jersey state and local government.\nA unique benefit that OPRAmachine provides is that once a public entity provides documents in response to a request, the documents are subsequently stored in the site\u0026rsquo;s database and made public, allowing the entire public to be able to reap the benefits. This model reduces duplicate requests and serves to further the OPRA law\u0026rsquo;s purpose of maximizing the citizenry\u0026rsquo;s knowledge of public affairs.\nThousands of pages released Since its inception in October, 2017, the OPRAmachine platform has enabled the release of thousands of pages of government documents. Our database of public bodoies currently includes all 565 municipalities in New Jersey, with more public bodies being added on a regular basis. The site has been making an impact and has been used as a research tool by public officials, journalists and activists seeking to obtain authoritative information about public entities in the state. We recently added a documentation that includes detailed information about the process of making a request through the site, as well as reference material concerning the legal and site administration issues that may arise as a result of the site\u0026rsquo;s operation.\nPraise for OPRAmachine \u0026ldquo;One of the most important tools making New Jersey government more transparent.\u0026rdquo; - Citizens Media TV\n\u0026ldquo;Thanks to Gavin Rozzi’s “OPRA Machine” website, the Atlantic County Government can no longer pretend to be transparent.

This website was launched in late January, 2018 and since that date has continued to stream \u0026amp; archive multiple police, fire \u0026amp; EMS radio channels.\nThis website is powered by the latest software defined radio (SDR) technology to process the streams of digital data produced by the Ocean County trunked radio system and also record analog conventional systems used by some departments \u0026amp; squads. The SDRs record radio transmissions and upload them to the site\u0026rsquo;s server, which allows them to easily be played and archived online. When Ocean County activates the new 700 MHz P25 Phase II radio system, our receivers will only need a simple software configuration change in order to pick up the new system\u0026rsquo;s signal. This flexibility makes SDR radios superior for this particular application, allowing us to provide a wide amount of channels on our system.\nThe system has a major advantage over all traditional forms of radio scanning as it uses \u0026ldquo;time shifting\u0026rdquo; like a DVR does when recording multiple overlapping TV shows, ensuring that no transmissions are missed, since traditional scanners can only hold on just one channel - potentially missing other calls that could be taking place on different talkgroups.\nThis system is powered by multiple R820T SDRs running on a desktop computer and connected to the front-end web server accessed by end users.\nAs our base of users continues to grow, I intend on covering more radio systems and adding them to this system.\nThe Ocean County Radio Live web application is based on the open-source Trunk-Player Django project. So far, I have contributed one pull request to the upstream open source software that powers the project, and I plan to contribute more in the future as my schedule allows.\nCurrent scan list lineup  Brick Fire \u0026amp; EMS Cape May County Delaware River Bridges Garden State Parkway Lacey Twp.
