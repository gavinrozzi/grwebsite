      <description>Ocean County College (Fall, 2017 semester):
 ALDC 102 - Addictions Counseling II  In this class, working with Professor Jack Brogan, I participated in an exercise that saw the students create their own jobs program for recovering addicts. Given the pervasiveness of the opioid epidemic in Ocean County, participating in this class gave me a unique perspective on the various solutions to the addiction crisis. I also provided technology assistance throughout the semester to this class, and helped to modernize the delivery of course materials compared to methods employed in past years.</description>
