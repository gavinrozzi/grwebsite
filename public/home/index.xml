      <description>Ocean County College (Fall, 2017 semester):
 ALDC 102 - Addictions Counseling II   In this class, working with Professor John A. Brogan, Sr., I participated in an exercise that saw the students create their own jobs program for recovering addicts. Students addressed recidivism and integrating recovering addicts into community organizations &amp;amp; programs.
A significant role that I played in this class was providing technology assistance to the professor and helping to modernize teaching methods.</description>
