      <description>I served as a teaching assistant for the following courses at Ocean County College:
 ALDC 102 - Addictions Counseling II (Fall, 2017 Semester) In this class, working with Professor Jack Brogan, I participated in an exercise that saw the students create their own jobs program for recovering addicts. Given the pervasiveness of the opioid epidemic in Ocean County, participating in this class gave me a unique perspective on the various solutions to the addiction crisis.</description>
