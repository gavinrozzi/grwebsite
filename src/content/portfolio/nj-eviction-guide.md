## Overview

The NJ Eviction Guide is an interactive self-help tool designed to connect New Jersey's most vulnerable residents directly to housing assistance and legal resources. This platform addresses a critical need in the state by providing accessible, easy-to-understand guidance for residents facing housing insecurity.

## Impact

**Empowering residents to navigate the eviction process**

The platform serves as a vital resource for:
- Residents facing eviction or housing insecurity
- Spanish-speaking communities through full localization
- Social service providers
- Legal aid organizations
- Housing counselors

**Breaking Language Barriers**

Under my oversight, the platform was expanded to include comprehensive Spanish translation and localization, dramatically expanding access to critical housing resources. This implementation ensures that New Jersey's significant Spanish-speaking population can access vital information about tenant rights, court processes, and emergency assistance in their primary language. By removing language barriers, the bilingual implementation increases equity and ensures that vulnerable residents can navigate complex legal processes regardless of their English proficiency.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Guidance**: Step-by-step assistance tailored to individual circumstances
- **Resource Locator**: Connects users to emergency assistance programs
- **Legal Information**: Clear explanations of tenant rights and court processes
- **Bilingual Access**: Full Spanish translation and localization for equitable access
- **Mobile-First Design**: Optimized for users on any device
- **Culturally Responsive**: Content adapted for diverse communities

## Technology Stack

Built with modern, accessible web technologies:
- **React** for interactive user interfaces
- **TypeScript** for type-safe, maintainable code
- **Internationalization (i18n)** for seamless language switching
- **Responsive Design** ensuring accessibility across devices
- **Government Hosting** on secure NJ.gov infrastructure

## Recognition

This project demonstrates how thoughtful technology implementation can directly serve vulnerable populations and improve access to critical government services. The platform has become an essential tool for housing counselors and legal aid providers across New Jersey. The Spanish localization initiative represents a significant step forward in equitable access to justice, ensuring that language is no longer a barrier to understanding tenant rights and accessing emergency housing assistance.
