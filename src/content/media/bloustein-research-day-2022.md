Presented research on developing a spatial risk model to predict community vulnerability to opiate overdoses at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy's annual Research Day event.

## Research Overview

The opiate crisis has directly affected many communities across New Jersey, creating an urgent need for evidence-based approaches to understanding and addressing this public health emergency. This research project introduced a novel spatial risk modeling approach to assess community vulnerability.

## Project Goals

The primary objective was to develop a comprehensive spatial risk model that could:
- Identify communities most vulnerable to opiate overdoses
- Understand the relationship between place and overdose risk
- Guide targeted intervention and resource allocation
- Support evidence-based policy decisions

## Methodology: People, Places & Things

The research employed a holistic "People, Places & Things" framework that integrated multiple data dimensions:

### People: Socio-Demographic Factors
- Population demographics and age distributions
- Economic indicators and poverty rates
- Educational attainment levels
- Health insurance coverage
- Historical overdose data

### Places: Built Environment
- Access to healthcare facilities and treatment centers
- Proximity to pharmacies and prescription sources
- Transportation infrastructure and accessibility
- Housing quality and neighborhood characteristics
- Urban vs. rural community types

### Things: Integrated Data Sources
- Emergency medical services call data
- Hospital admission records
- Prescription monitoring program data
- Law enforcement incident reports
- Social determinants of health indicators

## Spatial Risk Modeling Approach

The research utilized advanced geospatial analysis techniques:
- Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for spatial data integration
- Statistical modeling to identify risk factors
- Machine learning algorithms for prediction
- Visualization of vulnerability hotspots across New Jersey
- Temporal analysis to track trends over time

## Key Findings and Implications

The preliminary results revealed:
- Significant geographic variation in vulnerability across the state
- Complex interactions between demographic, environmental, and access factors
- Opportunity for targeted prevention and intervention strategies
- Need for place-based public health approaches

## Impact on Policy and Practice

This research aimed to provide actionable intelligence for:
- Public health officials planning intervention programs
- Emergency services optimizing resource deployment
- Treatment providers identifying underserved areas
- Policymakers developing evidence-based strategies
- Community organizations addressing local needs

## Future Directions

Ongoing work includes:
- Expanding the model to include additional data sources
- Validating predictions against new overdose data
- Developing an interactive web-based tool for stakeholders
- Exploring applications to other public health challenges
- Collaborating with state and local partners for implementation
