Gavin Rozzi presented this workshop as part of CoPPER's four-part series on AI in state government research, providing state employees with practical demonstrations of how to move AI use cases from experimental prompts to production-ready government services.

## Workshop Series Context

This presentation was the culminating session in CoPPER's inaugural AI workshop series, "Workshops: AI in State Research," held throughout July 2025. The series featured four Thursday sessions, each showcasing different applications of AI by state employees in their operational roles. Rozzi's session focused specifically on advanced implementation and production deployment of AI solutions.

### Series Overview

The workshop series covered:
- **July 10**: State of AI in the State - Use Cases, Tools, and Policy (Dr. Walker Gosrich, NJ Office of Innovation)
- **July 17**: Automate Anything (Almost) - AI Integration with Power Automate and Microsoft 365 (Brendan Lee, NJ Department of Children and Families)
- **July 24**: Leveraging AI for State Research - Advanced Techniques in Qualitative Data Analysis (Dr. Jory Catalpa)
- **July 31**: From Prompt to Public Service - Putting Advanced AI Use Cases into Production (Gavin Rozzi, NJ Department of Community Affairs)

Each 1.5-hour workshop combined one hour of learning and demonstration with 30 minutes of Q&A, creating an interactive format for peer learning among state employees.

## Role and Expertise

Rozzi presented in his capacity as Director of the Division of Housing & Community Resources Data Center at the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs. In this role, he leads division-wide strategy for data governance, analytics, and modern digital services supporting housing, eviction prevention, lead-safety, and other critical programs.

His practical experience includes:
