Shore News Network covered the Governor's Team of Excellence Award ceremony, highlighting recognition for work on the A4/S50 affordable housing data initiative at the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs.

## Award Recognition

Honored with the Governor's Team of Excellence Award during New Jersey's State Employee Recognition Day ceremony held Wednesday, May 7, at the Trenton War Memorial. The award celebrates state employees who demonstrate a strong commitment to public service and help the Governor achieve his goal of making New Jersey a fairer and stronger place to live and work.

## A4/S50 Team Contributions

Recognized as a member of the A4/S50 team, which led the release of affordable housing data under the landmark A4 legislation. The team developed calculations to guide municipalities in planning future affordable housing development. While the figures are nonbinding, they have been widely adopted by towns across the state and are used to support housing efforts for residents across income levels.

**Ongoing Impact:**

"This team continues to provide support to municipalities with data resources and enhancements and tailored guidance for towns throughout the state," the NJDCA said in a statement.

## State Leaders Praise Public Service

The A4/S50 initiative plays a key role in informing housing policy across New Jersey, with efforts highlighted for their contribution to advancing the administration's housing goals.

**NJDCA Commissioner Jacquelyn A. Suárez:**

"I'm incredibly proud of our DCA employees who were honored with a Governor's Award during State Employee Recognition Week. Their dedication, innovation, and unwavering commitment to public service exemplify the very best of our department and the State of New Jersey."

**Civil Service Commission Chair Allison Chris Myers:**

"Each of our honorees has made a significant impact in their respective fields and on the lives of New Jersey residents."
