Gavin Rozzi presented an interactive workshop at Montclair State University's Center for Cooperative Media, demonstrating [OPRAmachine](/portfolio/opramachine/) - his free, statewide platform for accessing New Jersey government records through the Open Public Records Act (OPRA).

## Event Overview

This hybrid event combined an in-person presentation with live webinar access, making the training available to journalists, researchers, advocates, and citizens across New Jersey interested in using public records laws to hold government accountable.

## The Problem OPRAmachine Solves

### Challenges with Traditional OPRA Process

**Legal Right vs. Practical Reality**
Every New Jersey citizen has the legal right to access public records held by state and local government agencies under the Open Public Records Act. By law, government entities must respond to properly submitted requests. However, the practical process for exercising this right presents numerous obstacles:

**Fragmented System**
- Each municipality and agency has its own process
- Contact information is often difficult to find
- No standardized request format across agencies
- Multiple custodians of records within organizations
- Inconsistent response procedures

**Technical Barriers**
- Many agencies lack online submission systems
- Paper-based processes create delays
- Fax and mail requirements are common
- No centralized tracking mechanism
- Difficult to follow up on pending requests

**Lack of Transparency**
- No public visibility into what records exist
- Requesters working in isolation
- Duplicative requests waste agency resources
- No shared knowledge base of successful requests
- Denied requests lack public documentation

**Intimidation Factor**
- Complex legal language can deter citizens
- Fear of retaliation in small communities
- Uncertainty about what to request
- Concerns about costs and fees
- Lack of examples or templates

### OPRAmachine's Solution

OPRAmachine transforms this fragmented, opaque process into a simple, transparent system where:
- Anyone can file a request in minutes
- All requests and responses are publicly visible
- The platform handles delivery and tracking
- Users learn from each other's requests
- Government accountability is enhanced through transparency
