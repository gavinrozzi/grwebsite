Joined Dean Stuart Shapiro on the EJB Talks podcast to discuss starting my role as Research Computing Specialist at Rutgers University's Bloustein School, just days before New Jersey's stay-at-home order during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Episode Overview

This episode explored the newly founded Rutgers Urban and Civic Informatics Lab (RUCI Lab) at the Bloustein School, its mission to use emerging data sources and technologies to study urban health, and how these insights can improve the quality of urban life.

## About the RUCI Lab

The [Rutgers Urban and Civic Informatics Lab (RUCI Lab)](https://rucilab.rutgers.edu/) was established with a forward-thinking mission:
- Using new sources of data to study the health of cities
- Leveraging emerging technologies for urban research
- Improving quality of urban life through data-driven insights
- Bridging the gap between technology and urban policy

## Key Discussion Topics

### Starting During a Pandemic

Joining the Bloustein School as a Research Computing Specialist just days before the state's stay-at-home order presented unique challenges and opportunities for remote research collaboration.

### COVID-19 Research Projects

The RUCI Lab's response to the pandemic included several innovative research initiatives:

**Geographic and Social Media Data Analysis**
- Using location data to understand mobility patterns during lockdowns
- Analyzing social media data to gauge public sentiment and behavior
- Predicting long-term social impacts of the pandemic
- Forecasting economic consequences for urban areas

**Urban Health Research**
- Studying how COVID-19 affected different urban neighborhoods
- Identifying vulnerable communities through data analysis
- Supporting evidence-based policy responses

### 3D Printing PPE for Healthcare Workers

Beyond research, I discussed my personal initiative using emerging technology to address critical shortages:
- 3D printing personal protective equipment (PPE) for frontline healthcare workers
- Collaborating with maker communities to scale production
- Bridging the gap between technology enthusiasts and healthcare needs
- Demonstrating practical applications of emerging technologies during crises

## Impact and Vision

The conversation highlighted how the intersection of data science, emerging technologies, and urban policy can create meaningful change, especially during times of crisis. The RUCI Lab's work exemplified how academic institutions can rapidly respond to real-world challenges while conducting groundbreaking research.
