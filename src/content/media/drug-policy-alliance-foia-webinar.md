Gavin Rozzi presented this webinar for the Department of Research and Academic Engagement at Drug Policy Alliance, introducing freedom of information laws as powerful research tools for academic researchers studying public administration and policy issues.

## Overview

While freedom of information laws are frequently utilized by journalists to uncover documents and data at state and federal levels, they remain an under-utilized but powerful tool for academic researchers. This webinar provided researchers with practical knowledge to leverage FOIA laws for obtaining valuable research data from government agencies.

## Presentation Context

The Drug Policy Alliance invited Rozzi to share his expertise based on his extensive experience using public records laws to support research projects and build civic technology platforms. His work with [OPRAmachine](/portfolio/opramachine/), New Jersey's first statewide freedom of information platform, demonstrated the research potential of systematically requesting and analyzing government data.

## Key Topics Covered
