Presented at the annual Code for America Summit, sharing experiences and lessons learned from building and operating OPRAmachine, New Jersey's statewide public records platform.

## Presentation Overview

The talk focused on the practical realities of running a civic technology platform at scale, moving beyond the excitement of launch to discuss sustainability, maintenance, and long-term impact.

### Key Themes

**Building for Sustainability**
- Technical choices that reduce maintenance burden
- Documentation strategies for long-term maintainability
- Balancing feature requests with platform stability
- Managing technical debt in civic projects

**User Community Development**
- Growing from early adopters to mainstream users
- Supporting diverse user needs (journalists, advocates, researchers, citizens)
- Building trust with both requesters and government agencies
- Creating feedback loops for continuous improvement

**Measuring Impact**
- Beyond vanity metrics: what actually matters?
- Tracking transparency outcomes, not just usage
- Qualitative impact through user stories
- Demonstrating value to funders and partners

**Scaling Challenges**
- Infrastructure considerations for growth
- Cost management for civic projects
- Handling legal and policy questions at scale
- Building redundancy and reliability

### Audience Engagement

The presentation included:
- Live platform demonstrations
- Real user stories and case studies
- Q&A on technical architecture decisions
- Discussion of failures and lessons learned

### Community Response

The talk resonated strongly with the civic tech community, particularly practitioners working on similar transparency and accountability projects. Multiple attendees expressed interest in replicating the platform model in their states.

## Key Takeaways Shared

1. **Start Simple**: Launch with core features that work reliably rather than comprehensive features that break
2. **Listen Constantly**: Users will tell you what they need—if you create channels to hear them
3. **Government Relations Matter**: Technology is only part of the solution; relationships with agencies are crucial
4. **Plan for Success**: Consider what happens when thousands of people depend on your platform
5. **Document Everything**: Future maintainers (including future you) will be grateful

## Resources Shared

- Open source codebase and documentation
- Technical architecture diagrams
- User research findings
- Best practices for government partnerships

The presentation materials were made publicly available to support others building similar platforms.

## Follow-Up

The talk led to ongoing collaborations with civic tech groups in other states interested in implementing similar transparency platforms, demonstrating the power of open sharing in the civic technology community.
