New Jersey's Open Public Records Act (OPRA) gives residents powerful tools to access government information. Here's how to use them effectively.

## What is OPRA?

The Open Public Records Act (N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1 et seq.) establishes the public's right to access government records. It's based on a simple premise: government records belong to the people.

### What You Can Request

Almost any government record is accessible, including:
- Email correspondence
- Meeting minutes and agendas
- Contracts and purchase orders
- Budget documents
- Personnel files (with some redactions)
- Inspection reports
- Geographic data and maps
- Surveillance footage

### What's Exempt

Limited exemptions protect:
- Ongoing criminal investigations
- Attorney-client privileged communications
- Personnel privacy matters
- Security plans
- Trade secrets
- Inter-agency or intra-agency advisory materials

## How to File an OPRA Request

### 1. Identify the Custodian

Each government entity has a designated records custodian. For:
- **Municipalities**: Usually the Municipal Clerk
- **Counties**: County Clerk
- **State agencies**: Each agency designates its own custodian

### 2. Be Specific

Vague requests can be denied. Instead of:
❌ "All emails about the Main Street project"

Try:
✅ "All emails sent or received by the Mayor between January 1, 2023 and March 31, 2023 containing the words 'Main Street reconstruction'"

### 3. Use the Right Form

Most agencies provide OPRA request forms. Key elements:
- Your name and contact information
- Clear description of records sought
- Preferred format (PDF, Excel, etc.)
- Date range if applicable

### 4. Submit It

You can typically submit via:
- In-person at agency office
- Email to records custodian
- Mail (certified recommended)
- Online portal (like OPRAmachine.com)

## Response Timeline

Agencies must respond within **7 business days** with either:
- The records
- A date when they'll be available (must be reasonable)
- Denial with legal justification
- Clarification request if your request is unclear

## Fees and Costs

### What Agencies Can Charge

- **Copies**: Up to $0.05 per page for letter or legal size
- **Special service charge**: Actual cost if request requires "extraordinary expenditure of time"
- **Postage**: Actual mailing costs

### What They Cannot Charge

- Staff time for locating and redacting (unless truly extraordinary)
- Conversion to electronic format if they maintain records electronically

## If Your Request is Denied

### 1. Ask for Written Explanation

The custodian must cite the specific OPRA exemption and explain how it applies.

### 2. File an Appeal

Within 45 days, you can file with:
- **Government Records Council (GRC)** - Free mediation
- **Superior Court** - More formal but potentially expensive

### 3. Seek Qualified Attorney

If you prevail, you may recover attorney's fees.

## Tips for Success

### Be Patient but Persistent

- Give reasonable time for complex requests
- Follow up if you don't hear back
- Document all communications

### Build Relationships

- Be professional and courteous
- Understand resource constraints
- Work collaboratively when possible

### Start Small

- Begin with simple requests to learn the process
- Expand to more complex requests as you gain experience
- Don't overwhelm agencies with massive requests

### Use Technology

## Common Use Cases

### Investigative Journalism

Reporters use OPRA to uncover:
- Government spending irregularities
- Public safety concerns
- Environmental violations
- Political conflicts of interest

### Citizen Advocacy

Residents request records to:
- Monitor local development projects
- Review school board decisions
- Track police activity
- Understand budget priorities

### Business Intelligence

Companies seek information about:
- Competitor government contracts
- Zoning and land use decisions
- Infrastructure projects
- Regulatory compliance

### Academic Research

Researchers analyze government data for:
- Policy effectiveness studies
- Historical documentation
- Geographic analysis
- Demographic trends

## Red Flags: When to Push Back

### Improper Denials

Watch for:
- Vague exemption claims
- Delays without explanation
- Excessive fees
- "Lost" records that likely exist

### Bad Faith Indicators

- Records "accidentally" destroyed after request
- Unreasonable redactions
- Duplicate requests for clarification
- Retaliation against requesters

## Real World Example

**Request**: Police department's use of force policy and training records

**Initial Response**: Denied as "security information"

**Appeal**: Argued that general policies don't compromise security

**Outcome**: GRC ordered release with minor redactions for specific tactical procedures

## The Bigger Picture

OPRA requests serve democracy by:
- **Preventing corruption** through sunlight
- **Informing voters** about government actions
- **Enabling accountability** for public officials
- **Empowering communities** to participate in governance

## Your Rights are Real

Government officials may discourage requests, but remember:
- You don't need to explain why you want records
- You have a legal right to this information
- Retaliation is prohibited
- Free legal help is available
